                <p>
                    Chase has the power to change his own form or the forms of others using his magic abilities. For the
                    most part his magic follows the general guidelines of magic in his world. However, because the
                    source of his power comes from his chrysolite pendant, there are some distinguishing characteristics
                    of his transformation magic.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <div class="chase-magic-image chase-pendant"></div>
                <p class="chase-magic-text">
                    Chase relies on a set of conditions to be met in order to use his magic. First of all, he has to
                    be in possession of his chrysolite pendant. The runed artifact acts as the source of his power. He
                    usually hides it underneath his shirt for safekeeping. Second, he must be in an animate state.
                    Without the ability to move, he is incapable of tapping into his life force.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <div class="chase-magic-image chase-surprise-tf"></div>
                <p class="chase-magic-text">
                    Chase's pendant is bound to his life force. This means that even if someone takes it, they are not
                    able to use the power held within it. However, this does allow anyone else to manipulate Chase's
                    shapeshifting qualities. The chrysolite pendant reacts to the life force of the wielder and gives
                    them the abilities to transform Chase merely by willing it or wanting him to become something else.
                    This does have the potential to drain his magic power, so it can do great damage to him if placed
                    in the wrong hands.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <div class="chase-magic-image chase-magic-zap"></div>
                <p class="chase-magic-text">
                    Chase's life force reserves give him mana for 10 charges of magic abilities. A simple shapeshift
                    costs him 1 charge. These simple shapeshifts require him to maintain his coloration and markings
                    when changing form. He can then continue to change form at will. Chase can also fire blasts of his
                    magic energy for 1 charge. The energy can come out in a variety of ways, but he usually prefers to
                    fire it off in a zap or in the form of his patented Ha-dook-en energy blast. This works in a similar
                    manner to his simple shapeshift ability: The recipient of the blast is transformed into a shape of
                    his choosing.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <p class="chase-magic-text">
                    For 2 charges, he can do a simple shapeshift while merging the pendant with his body. This makes him
                    capable of concealing the presence of the relic in forms which would not normally make this
                    possible. For 3 charges, he can do a complex shapeshift. These transformations do not require him
                    to keep his coloration or markings. The only restrictions to these forms are that the pendant must
                    be merged with and bound to his form and he must display the pendant's rune somewhere on his body.
                    Primarily, it is placed squarely on his back or on the back of his hands.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <div class="chase-magic-image chase-chimera"></div>
                <p class="chase-magic-text">
                    For 5 charges, Chase can take his chimera form. His chimera form is an amalgamation of various other
                    creatures which include dragon, deer, rabbit, falcon, and skunk. This highly integrated form does
                    grant him the most useful abilities of each creature he consists of. The amount of magic energy put
                    into this form also allows him to do simple, 1-mana shapeshifts for free until his body tires out.
                    However, Chase is generally bashful about taking this form and prefers not to use it unless
                    absolutely necessary.
                </p>

                    As a side note no matter what form he takes through his shapeshifting abilities, his clothes change
                    form with him. They are all laced with SmartThread, an invention created by Malichi specifically
                    for Chase. SmartThread is capable of detecting the use of his magic and changing shape to fit his
                    new form. He can also use a charge of his magic to change his clothes into any other type of
                    clothing he wants. However, transformations or changes in his body made outside the use of his
                    magic will have no effect on his clothing.
