                    <p>
                        <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                        Malichi is very dedicated to his work. Whenever he begins on a project, he will continue on
                        tirelessly for days on end. He hates being disturbed while tinkering with his machines. In fact,
                        he has a rather short temper most of the time. He becomes angered easily by such annoyances.
                        Malichi may even react with minor force if provoked enough. He has no patience for stupidity
                        either. When relaxed and not busy, he acts like a perfect gentleman. The mouse likes taking in
                        fine arts, theater, and cuisine during his downtime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                        While his small size makes many tasks and feats difficult for him, Malichi can squeeze into
                        tight spaces with ease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Skills: </strong>
                        Malichi is a master at building various machines, robots, and other powerful technological
                        devices. He can easily identify, dissect, or operate nearly any form of machine. In particular,
                        he has various computers and mechs built that can operate various devices that he himself is
                        too small to use.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Background:</strong>
                        Malichi was born much to his parents' surprise. Having been born with the birth defect known as
                        microtism, he was not even an inch tall. Microtic mice generally have a lifespan of only two
                        years, so everyone was concerned for his well-being. His parents allowed a scientist to test
                        some experimental nanites on him. These nanites would move through his body and act in such a
                        way that would lower his metabolism and heart rate to a more manageable level. Despite the
                        inherent risks of such an experiment, it was very successful.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, Malichi grew up under the close care of his parents. They cared for him in his
                        small, fragile state. They homeschooled him as well; being from a bloodline of extremely
                        intelligent people, they gave him an education that was better than anything he could receive
                        at a public school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His education was furthered when he was accepted by a prestigious machinery university. Not only
                        did he enroll as a student, but he also worked as a test subject for those who worked on
                        nanites similar to the one in his body. They intended to improve them or find a way to use them
                        to reverse his microtism. Soon enough, another microtic Anthro joined the school in the same
                        capacity. He and Malichi became partners and decided to work on a cure together. They worked
                        tirelessly on a method to increase their height. When it came time for the first test, both
                        students volunteered to try it first. They fought over who should use the newly created nanites
                        until their adviser made the decision to let Malichi use them. When he tested them, however,
                        his metabolism and heart rate couldn't keep up with his enlarged form. He became gravely ill to
                        the point that the experiment was called off. The two students blamed each other for the mishap
                        and have been rivals ever since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon graduation from college, Malichi opened his own workshop to create and sell his machines.
                        The money he made off his inventions went into his continued research toward a cure for
                        his microtism. The incapability of the body management nanites and any form of growth whether
                        through machine or magic continues to confound him, despite becoming a world renowned scientist
                        in his field.

                    <p>
                        Malichi eventually befriended <a href="chase.html">Chase</a>. Dejected about a recent failure
                        with his microtism cure, Chase happened to come by him and cheered him up. Chase knows how to
                        make Malichi feel big, and that made him a valued friend to the tiny mouse. In return Malichi
                        gave the fox a job as his bodyguard upon learning about his shapeshifting abilities. No
                        matter how Chase might annoy or anger him, he would continue to help him and keep him around. Of
                        course, the same can't be said of Chase's friends. <a href="ruby.html">Ruby</a> often sneaks
                        into his lab to have some artifact of hers tested, usually with destructive results.
                        On the other hand, <a href="katrina.html">Katrina</a> likes to invoke his fear of felines and
                        chase him around as a feral cat.
