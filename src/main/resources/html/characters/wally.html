                        <strong>Full name:</strong> Wallace Cognisarian<br>
                        <strong>Species:</strong> Least Weasel (<em>Mustela nivalis</em>)<br>
                        <strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br>

                        <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                        Wally is a very vain person. He thinks about himself above all others. He believes that because
                        he is smarter than most people, he is above them. He is quite intelligent, though, and does tend
                        to come up with many brilliant ideas. When it comes to actually working on those ideas, he would
                        rather deflect the hard work to someone bigger and stronger than he is. In his defense, Wally is
                        rather small in size and can't actually do some of the work himself. He lets his stature get to
                        him from time to time, however. In fact he fiercely defends himself whenever anyone points out
                        his height. Still, he usually wears clothes that are too big for him.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                        Wally's small size and slender body makes it easy for him to fir into tight spots.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Skills: </strong>
                        Wally is a highly skilled machinist and has a thorough understanding of robotics and nanites. He
                        has deep knowledge of various machines and can control or operate them as needed. He utilizes
                        many different devices to program and manipulate some of his machines to do his work for him.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Background:</strong>
                        Wally was born with the birth defect known as microtism, a disease in which an anthro's size
                        matches that of their species' primordial counterpart. It affects every aspect of their
                        well-being, including their lifespan. Wally was injected with nanites as a newborn that would
                        monitor and maintain his metabolism, body temperature, and various other vital signs to keep him
                        well and healthy. Regardless of the nanites keeping him alive, his small size still made him
                        fragile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wally's parents had to be protective of him in his early years. He went to public school when he
                        came of age, and his classmates made fun of him for his small size. He did show remarkable
                        intelligence nonetheless. Due to these facts, his parents made sure to coddle him and boost his
                        ego by telling him how great he was. As he grew up, it only led him to become somewhat full of
                        himself. His arrogance did help him avert the taunting of his classmates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The weasel lived a full life up until the point he left for college. Due to his brilliance, he
                        was accepted into a great university for advanced mechanics. It was there that he met Malichi.
                        The two shared a similar plight: They both intended to find a cure for their microtism. They
                        worked as test subjects for other students testing new nanites and worked on their own projects
                        together. When the time came to test new nanites that would hopefully cure their microtism,
                        Wally and Malichi fought amongst each other over who would be the first to try them. When they
                        couldn't decidde between the two of them, their adviser instructed Malichi to try them first.
                        Wally was extremely jealous of Malichi. The experiment still went on as planned, though the
                        weasel would watch from afar. The nanites ended up being a huge failure, and the experiment was
                        called off. Wally and Malichi fought even more amongst each other over why the project failed,
                        blaming one another for it. It seemed like from the beginning the project was doomed to create
                        a rift between these two once close friends. They never made up with each other since that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the failure, Wally graduated magna cum laude from the university. He would go on to work
                        at a major company at first. Feeling that his talents were wasted at the corporation and hating
                        working for someone else, he ended up starting his own company. He took on a few apprentices and
                        hired some people to help him do the heavy lifting, and his small business boomed in a short
                        time. Although he never was extremely wealthy, his company flourished and made him financially
                        stable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To this day, he still holds a grudge against Malichi for their failed experiment. Who knows what
                        would happen should the two meet again...
