                            <strong>Bio:</strong>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                            Chase has the ability to shapeshift at will into practically any form he can imagine. He can
                            also change the forms of other people by flowing his magic energy into someone via physical
                            contact or forcing the energy through a wave of magic, for example in the form of his "Magic
                            Zap" or "Ha-dook-en" ability. His magic has some limits as he is unable to change specific
                            aspects of his body like his height or weight unless its specific to the form he takes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Skills: </strong>
                            Chase has a knack for working with computers. Through his shapeshifting abilities, he has
                            also improved his knowledge of different lifeforms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Background:</strong>
                            Not much is known about the circumstances of his birth. Chase was found as an orphan by his
                            vulpine foster parents, Paul and Vivien l'Orange. When the fox couple found him, he was in
                            the form of a fox kit with a mysterious chrysolite pendant softly wrapped with care among
                            his fur. His birth parents have not been found to this day, and he has no known blood
                            relatives at this time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chase was raised as the lone child of the l'Orange family and maintained his identity as a
                            red fox. At an early age, he and his parents discovered the powers held within the
                            pendant with which he was found. The magic within in the strange talisman allowed him to
                            utilize transformation magic. He could not only shapeshift at will, but he could also focus
                            his energy to change the form of another. It took him a great deal of time and effort to
                            control this magic power. Various mishaps happened along the way that landed him in trouble
                            as a child. Some issues caused his family to become a source of outrage in their community
                            while other instances forced them out of town violently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Chase turned 18, he left his parents home for fear of causing them further problems and
                            went off to college. While working on a degree in information technology, he would continue
                            to test and master his magical abilities. Eventually, he was able to gain greater control
                            over his magic. Chase ended up using his shapeshifting abilities to help earn his way
                            through school. Once he graduated from college, he not only continued to do work using his
                            unique magic powers but also took a part-time job utilizing his learned trade.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In his late 20's Chase came across an old artifact belonging to his friend, Ruby Walker,
                            that was said to reveal one's true identity. Upon glancing into the mirror he learned of
                            his true form as an orange skunk, having believed his entire life that he was a fox.

                        <p>
                            No one seems to know the origin of the strangely colored mephit and his bloodline seems to
                            be lost in history; but is there some deeper meaning behind his appearance and powers...?
