                        <p>
                            <strong>Full name:</strong> Chase l'Orange<br>
                            <strong>Species:</strong> Striped Skunk (<em>Mephitis mephitis</em>)<br>
                            <strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br>
                            <strong>Age:</strong> late 20s<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 4' 0" (1.22 m)<br>
                            <strong>Occupation:</strong> Generalist<br>
                            <strong>Favorite Color:</strong> Orange<br>
                            <strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Fruit based confections, particularly creamsicles<br>
                            <strong>Likes:</strong> games, chilling out, transformation<br>
                            <strong>Dislikes:</strong> surprises, overworking, people disrespecting others
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Physical Traits:</strong>
                            Chase's fur has a bright orange hue to it, an oddity among his species. His ears are also
                            slightly larger than that of a typical skunk as well. Additionally, his scent is that of
                            oranges and cream rather than the odor often produced by those of his species. Regardless
                            of all the odd traits he possesses, he bears all the normal markings one would expect such
                            as the stripes leading from his nose and down his back to the tip of his tail. Chase's
                            choice of clothing often reflects his easygoing attitude. Regularly one will find him
                            wearing his light blue Hawaiian shirt with the flower and palm tree print. Once in a while,
                            he will also wear his shades.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                            Chase is generally a cheerful individual. A smile lighting up his bright orange muzzle or a
                            curious twitch of his oversized ears can be a soothing sight to others. He will joke around
                            and be playful with his friends, though sometimes he takes his games a bit too far. He is
                            also very easygoing, appearing to be loose and lax most of the time; Chase rarely seems to
                            have a problem chilling out at any given moment. His relaxed nature tends be his biggest
                            downfall, however. He never expects anything to go wrong and is often prone to being
                            surprised. He also becomes lazy on occasion too, occasionally at the wrong time.
                            Nevertheless, he has a sense of loyalty to others. He will go so far as to put himself in
                            harm's way to protect someone who is being bullied. Chase also hates to offend people, so
                            much so that he changed his scent magically to prevent his odor from causing a problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                            Chase has the ability to shapeshift at will into practically any form he can imagine. He can
                            also change the forms of other people by flowing his magic energy into someone via physical
                            contact or forcing the energy through a wave of magic, for example in the form of the "Magic
                            Zap" or "Ha-dook-en". His magic has some limits as he is unable to change specific
                            aspects of one's body like his height or weight unless its characteristic of the new form.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Skills: </strong>
                            Chase has a knack for working with computers. Through his shapeshifting abilities, he has
                            also improved his knowledge of different lifeforms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Background:</strong>
                            Not much is known about the circumstances of his birth. Chase was found as an orphan by his
                            vulpine foster parents, Paul and Vivien l'Orange. When the fox couple found him, he was in
                            the form of a fox kit with a mysterious chrysolite pendant softly wrapped with care among
                            his fur. His birth parents have not been found to this day, and he has no known blood
                            relatives at this time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chase was raised as the lone child of the l'Orange family and maintained his identity as a
                            red fox. At an early age, he and his parents discovered the powers held within the
                            pendant with which he was found. The magic within in the strange talisman allowed him to
                            utilize transformation magic. He could not only shapeshift at will, but he could also focus
                            his energy to change the form of another. It took him a great deal of time and effort to
                            control this magic power. Various mishaps happened along the way that landed him in trouble
                            as a child. Some issues caused his family to become a source of outrage in their community
                            while other instances forced them out of town violently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Chase turned 18, he left his parents home for fear of causing them further problems and
                            went off to college. While working on a degree in information technology, he would continue
                            to test and master his magical abilities in secret. Eventually, he was able to gain greater
                            control over his magic. Chase ended up using his shapeshifting abilities to help earn his
                            way through school. Once he graduated from college, he continued to use his unique magical
                            powers to do odd jobs (with the occasional computer job thrown in just to make use of his
                            degree.) He met several of his friends this way and still often takes on tasks as
                            Malichi's bodyguard, Katrina's subordinate, and Ruby's expedition assistant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2015, Chase came across an old artifact belonging to Ruby that was said to reveal one's
                            true identity. Upon glancing into the mirror he learned of his true form as a skunk,
                            having believed his entire life that he was a fox.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No one seems to know the origin of Chase's strange coloration and his bloodline seems to be
                            lost in history; but is there some deeper meaning behind his appearance and powers...?
