                            <strong>Full name:</strong> Chase Reynard<br>
                            <strong>Species:</strong> Red Fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>)<br>
                            <strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br>
                            <strong>Age:</strong> late 20s<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 4' 0" (1.22 m)<br>
                            <strong>Occupation:</strong> Jack of All Trades<br>

                            <strong>Dislikes:</strong> surprises, overworking, people disrespecting others
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                            Chase is generally a cheerful individual. A smile lighting up his bright orange muzzle or a
                            curious twitch of his triangular ears can be a soothing sight to others. He will joke around
                            and be playful with his friends, though sometimes he takes his games a bit too far. He is
                            also very easygoing, appearing to be loose and lax most of the time; Chase rarely seems to
                            have a problem chilling out at any given moment. His relaxed nature tends be his biggest
                            downfall, however. He never expects anything to go wrong and is often prone to being
                            surprised. He also becomes lazy at times, occasionally at the wrong moments. Nevertheless,
                            he has a sense of loyalty to others. He will go so far as to put himself in harm's way to
                            protect someone who is being bullied. Chase also hates to offend people and often finds
                            himself in awkward situations because of it.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                            Chase has the ability to shapeshift at will into practically any form he can imagine. He can
                            also change the forms of other people by flowing his magic energy into someone via physical
                            contact or forcing the energy through a wave of magic, for example in the form of the "Magic
                            Zap" or "Ha-dook-en". His magic has some limits as he is unable to change specific
                            aspects of one's body like his height or weight unless it's characteristic of the new form.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Background:</strong>
                            Not much is known about the circumstances of his birth. Chase was found as an orphan by his
                            vulpine foster parents, Paul and Vivien Reynard. When the fox couple found him, he was
                            wearing a mysterious chrysolite pendant softly wrapped with care among his fur. His birth
                            parents have not been found to this day, and he has no known blood relatives at this time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chase was raised as the lone child of the Reynard family. At an early age, he and his
                            parents discovered the powers held within the pendant with which he was found. The magic
                            within the strange talisman allowed him to utilize transformation magic. He could not only
                            shapeshift at will, but he could also focus his energy to change the form of another. It
                            took him a great deal of time and effort to control this magic power.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Various mishaps happened along the way that landed him in trouble as a child. Many of them
                            involved his strange chimera form, which he would sometimes shift into outside of his
                            control. This chimera form is an amalgamation of various creatures including a rabbit, a
                            dragon, and a deer. He would be laughed at for this form, and many would call him a monster
                            due to the different nature of this form. He also encountered some problems with his
                            transformation powers, accidentally turning other people into different creatures or
                            something else entirely. Some of these transformation issues caused his family to become a
                            source of outrage in their community while other instances forced them out of town
                            violently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Chase turned 18, he left his parents' home for fear of causing them further problems
                            and went off to a magic academy. Though not officially a student, the mages there observed
                            his strange abilities, help him gain greater control over his power, and allowed him to
                            control his amalgamate form. Chase ended up using his shapeshifting abilities to help earn
                            his stay at the academy. Upon leaving the academy he continued to use his unique magical
                            powers to do odd jobs as a way of making a living. He met several of his friends this way
                            and still often takes on tasks as <a href="malichi.html">Malichi</a>'s bodyguard,
                            <a href="katrina.html">Katrina</a>'s "assistant", and <a href="ruby.html">Ruby</a>'s
                            expedition partner.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Only recently, Chase came across an old artifact belonging to Ruby that was said to reveal
                            one's true identity. Upon glancing into the mirror he learned that the chimera form he had
                            been changed into often in his youth was his true form. No one seems to know the origin of
                            Chase's strange chimera form and his bloodline seems to be lost in history; but is there
                            some deeper meaning behind his appearance and powers...?
