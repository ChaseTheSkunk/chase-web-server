                        <strong>Full name:</strong> None<br>
                        <strong>Species:</strong> Dog - Husky mix (<em>Canis familiaris</em>)<br>
                        <strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                        Champ has a very rough, no-nonsense personality. He doesn't let anyone get too close emotionally
                        to him aside from his "father", Tempatrius. In fact, Champ will go to great lengths to distance
                        himself from people, oftentimes claiming he is "just a mutt" whom no one could ever love. His
                        whole life is his job. He trains for it whenever he doesn't have work to do, particularly in
                        keeping his body in top condition. Regardless of doing nothing outside of his occupation, he
                        feels thankful to have everything he does based on his situation before he was found by the
                        god of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                        Champ has knowledge in both the elemental and divine schools of time magic. He can cast these
                        spells nearly instantaneously as well. His spells include but are not limited to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Blink: Champ can jump forward in time to a new location a short distance away. Like any
                                other Blink spell, the amount of mana spent is dependent on how long it would take him
                                to reach the new destination.
                            </li>
                            <li>Temporal Recall: Champ can return an object to an earlier point in time. If something
                                breaks, he can make it like new again. If he throws a dagger at an opponent, he can
                                return it back to when it was in his hand.
                            </li>
                            <li>Slice of Time: Champ cuts the very fabric of time itself with his daggers to launch a
                                powerful arching projectile at an enemy.
                            </li>
                            <li>Age Manipulation: Champ can change the age of a target object or individual, returning
                                them to an earlier age all the way back to birth or creation or progressing them in age
                                to beyond death or destruction (even to the point of fossilization). Champ is one of the
                                few mortals who can cast this divine time spell, and it costs a significant amount of
                                mana to do. It can be resisted, as well, by targets with the appropriate abilities.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Skills: </strong>
                        Champ is skilled in combat with his prized legendary daggers, Prometheus and Epimetheus. He is
                        also proficient in hand-to-hand combat.

                        Wally is a highly skilled machinist and has a thorough understanding of robotics and nanites. He
                        has deep knowledge of various machines and can control or operate them as needed. He utilizes
                        many different devices to program and manipulate some of his machines to do his work for him.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Background:</strong>
                        Champ was completely abandoned by his parents at birth, not by choice but by circumstance. As a
                        newborn pup, his parents were killed in a monster attack. The whole village was ravaged by
                        monsters. The only survivor was the young pup who had lost an eye, an arm, and a leg in the
                        bloodshed. Near death before his life even began he was saved at the exact moment in time by
                        the god of time, Tempatrius. The sand dragon god saw that the pup had an extremely unique place
                        in the universe: His existence had no bearing on the Time Stream, the flow of all timelines that
                        determines the events that happen throught the universe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Champ was taken in his dire state and mended up by the god of time's own personal servants. The
                        newborn pup would make a full recovery from his near death experience save for a large claw mark
                        scar over his right eye. From that point he was progressed in age to his current form. He was
                        outfitted with technology suitable for a time-lost individual such as himself; Champ was given a
                        robotic arm from the Modern Age, a prosthetic leg from the Enlightened Age, and a cybernetic eye
                        from the Space Age.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once he was outfitted with the technology to make him whole again, Champ took his time being
                        educated and trained in the art of spellcasting and combat. He was given the best leather armor
                        available and equipped with the legendary daggers, Prometheus and Epimetheus, that are said to
                        have the ability to cut into the very fabric of time itself. After working as an apprentice
                        under one of the Agents of Temptrius, the mortals who act out the god's will in Casarok, he was
                        soon promoted to be the one and only Champion of Tempatrius due to his unique status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Champ now moves in and out of time to do special missions for Tempatrius in order to keep the
                        Time Stream in check. He has visited many different places at many different times through his
                        employment as the champion of a god. ALl in all, Champ remains thankful for everything he has.
                        The scar on his face reminds him everyday of what his fate could have been had he not been
                        adopted by his "father".
