                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                            Ruby is always on the move. She dislikes having to remain still or be bored. Whether it is
                            something simple like exercising or partying or as complex as a big adventure or dungeon
                            crawl, she is always ready and willing to do something active and interesting. In fact, she
                            is very excitable and will jump at the first opportunity to do something appealing to her.
                            To support her active lifestyle, she has become a bit of a health nut. She is a strict
                            vegetarian and stays up-to-date on all the latest health crazes. Needless to say, Ruby has
                            an outgoing personality but has the tendency to talk endlessly about particular topics when
                            put in a large group. Stories of her adventures can be exciting, but lectures on dusty ruins
                            might put people to sleep. Strangely enough, Ruby has trouble distinguishing sources of
                            magic. She often cannot determine the magical qualities of objects, particularly the
                            artifacts she keeps in her own collection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                            Ruby is exceptionally strong and athletic for someone her size. Being a kangaroo, she also
                            has great jumping and kicking strength.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Skills: </strong>
                            Ruby is an accomplished archeologist. She has a deeper than usual understanding of the lost
                            history of her homeworld as well as the ability to identify and analyze artifacts. She also
                            has a wide breadth of travel experience. Ruby is also skilled in the use of a wide array of
                            tools and weapons.

                            <strong>Background:</strong>
                            Ruby was born in <a href="../world/geography.html">Phaerolis</a>, a continent similar in
                            many ways to present day Australia on Earth. Among the Walker family, she is the eldest of
                            three children. While growing up she developed a fascination with the diversity of the ruins
                            and history in her homeland. She strived hard to learn about the history in her corner of
                            the world. Her natural curiosity led her to become quite accomplished throughout her
                            academic career, earning honors in many of her classes. She was also quite the athlete
                            growing up and played many different sports while in school. Eventually, all of her
                            accolades earned her a scholarship to one of the prestigious archeology schools in her home
                            country of Marsupia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ruby graduated from the university with her degree in archeology and began travelling the
                            world. In the span of only a few years, she became renowned for her adventures and findings.
                            She would eventually move to the central continent where she had shorter flight times to the
                            rest of the world. Currently, she lives in a fairly modest home; however, she owns a large
                            collection of artifacts stored in her den from adventures past.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ruby befriended <a href="chase.html">Chase</a> after he applied to assist her on one of her
                            expeditions. She found his shapeshifting abilities extremely useful and continues to call on
                            him for aid even to this day on some of the more challenging or burdening adventures. After
                            a few trips together, they became fast friends. However, she often finds herself helping
                            Chase out of a jam. She can be rather oblivious to transformation-related problems that
                            occur as well due to her confusion about his shapeshifting abilities and lack of magical
                            knowledge.
