                            <strong>Full name:</strong> Ruby Walker<br>
                            <strong>Species:</strong> Red kangaroo (<em>Macropus rufus</em>)<br>
                            <strong>Gender:</strong> Female<br>
                            <strong>Age:</strong> 26<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3' 11" (1.19 m)<br>
                            <strong>Occupation:</strong> Archeologist<br>
                            <strong>Favorite Color:</strong> Pink<br>
                            <strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Vegetarian Salad<br>
                            <strong>Likes:</strong> Adventure, parties, ruins<br>
                            <strong>Dislikes:</strong> Sitting still, women's fashion, meat
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Physical Traits:</strong>
                            Despite being a red kangaroo, Ruby's fur appears yellow in color with a chocolate hue
                            coating the tips of her ears, toes, and tail. Her blond hair is often kept long and can
                            sometimes be seen draped over her shoulder. The fur on her left ear is particularly fuzzy
                            and stands out particularly from her right ear. Everything else is fairly common among her
                            species: a long tail, big feet, and powerful legs. She does indeed have a pouch on her
                            abdomen as well, though it is often concealed by her clothing. Ruby typically wears a mix of
                            adventurer's garb and fashion from her native country. She will often be seen in her safari
                            shirt and shorts or akubra hat but will rarely ever put on a skirt or dress. On her right
                            hand, she wears a ruby ring that was given to her by a former colleague.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                            Ruby is always on the move. She dislikes having to remain still or be bored. Whether it is
                            something simple like exercising or partying or as complex as a big adventure or dungeon
                            crawl, she is always ready and willing to do something active and interesting. In fact, she
                            is very excitable and will jump at the first opportunity to do something appealing to her.
                            To support her active lifestyle, she has become a bit of a health nut. She is a strict
                            vegetarian and stays up-to-date on all the latest health crazes. Needless to say, Ruby has
                            an outgoing personality but has the tendency to talk endlessly about particular topics when
                            put in a large group. Stories of her adventures can be exciting, but lectures on dusty ruins
                            might put people to sleep. Strangely enough, Ruby has trouble distinguishing sources of
                            magic. She often cannot determine the magical qualities of objects, particularly the
                            artifacts she keeps in her own collection.

                            <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                            Ruby is exceptionally strong and athletic for someone her size. Being a kangaroo, she also
                            has great jumping and kicking strength.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Skills: </strong>
                            Ruby is an accomplished archeologist. She has a deeper than usual understanding of the lost
                            history of her homeworld as well as the ability to identify and analyze artifacts. She also
                            has a wide breadth of travel experience as she is constantly going all over the world for
                            her job. Ruby is also skilled in the use of a wide array of tools and weapons.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Background:</strong>
                            Ruby was born in Marsupia, a country in her homeworld similar in many ways to present day
                            Australia on Earth. Among the Walker family, she is the eldest of three children. She was
                            always quite the athlete growing up and played many different sports while in school.
                            Academically she was no slouch either and earned honors in most of her classes. The
                            diversity of the ruins and history in her homeland fascinated her. Eventually, her academic
                            and extracurricular accomplishments earned her a scholarship to one of the prestigious
                            archeology schools in her country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ruby graduated from the university with her degree in archeology and began travelling the
                            world. In the span of only a few years, she became renowned for her adventures and findings.
                            She would eventually move to the central continent where she had shorter flight times to the
                            rest of the world. Currently, she lives in a fairly modest home; however, she has a large
                            collection of artifacts stored in her den from adventures past.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ruby befriended Chase after he applied to assist her on one of her expeditions. She found
                            his shapeshifting abilities extremely useful and continued to call on him for aid on
                            some of the more challenging or burdening adventures. After a few trips together, they
                            became fast friends.
