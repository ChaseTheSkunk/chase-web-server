                        <strong>Full name:</strong> Noboru "Foxblade" Hayashi<br>
                        <strong>Species:</strong> <a href="../world/bestiary/kitsune.html">Kitsune</a> (<em>Vulpes kitsune</em>)<br>
                        <strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br>
                        <strong>Lifetime:</strong> Born in 879 CE, date of death unknown<br>
                        <strong>Height:</strong> 3' 10" (1.17 m)<br>
                        <strong>Occupation:</strong> Samurai, Mercenary<br>
                        <strong>Favorite Color:</strong> Silver<br>
                        <strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Sushi<br>
                        <strong>Likes:</strong> helping others, herbal remedies, cool attack names<br>
                        <strong>Dislikes:</strong> disruptions, being treated like a kid, the forces of evil
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                        Foxblade is eager to help others. He will step out of his own way to aid someone in need.
                        Nevertheless, it is also one of his greatest faults; he is more than willing to drop something
                        important if it means helping another person. It's also how he ends up in a modicum of trouble
                        as well. In his years as a young warrior, he hated being looked down upon for being a novice.
                        Every fight he lost came with an excuse, but it also came with a fiery passion to improve his
                        skills. He was also fascinated with giving his weapons and spells interesting names. As Foxblade
                        aged he grew wiser and calmer. As a veteran samurai, he became more interested in passing down
                        his skills to others. In the end, his motivation to help others still fueled his actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                        Foxblade knows some light, space, and spirit magic. As with most kitsunes in the late
                        <a href="../world/history.html">Pre-Cataclysmic Era</a>, his mana pool and magic powers
                        increased as he passed the Eight Trials and gained more tails. His most commonly used spells
                        include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fox Fire: A ranged spirit-based spell that hurls an orb of soulfire at an enemy.</li>
                            <li>Lantern Light: A light-based spell that summons a burst of light from the kitsune's
                                "lantern". The spell becomes stronger based on the soul used to create the lantern.
                            </li>
                            <li>Conjure Weapon/Armor: A space-based spells that generates a weapon or piece of armor out
                                of pure mana. The weapon or armor lasts until dispelled, either by the user or an
                                opposing disruptive spell.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Skills: </strong>
                        Foxblade has skills with several different weapons, including swords, polearms, and bows.
                        Additionally, he has some knowledge of herbal remedies; however, this skill is fairly limited
                        and is only useful in minor situations such as first aid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Story:</strong>
                        Noboru was born in an age when all kitsunes were no longer living in Casarok due to the
                        Culling of the Kitsune. He was born under four stars, a sign of death that left elder kitsune
                        scratching their heads. His grandfather, one such elder kitsune, suggested that the boy be
                        raised as an ordinary fox in the remote Escanina Islands of Casarok to avoid any ill fate that
                        may befall the rest of the kitsune in <a href="../world/pantheon.html">Mother</a>'s Realm. His
                        parents reluctantly agreed to these terms and left for the islands. Unfortunately, Noboru's
                        parents mysteriously disappeared when they brought him back to Casarok. The other kistune feared
                        they were dead and that this was the warning given by the four stars. In their stead, his
                        grandfather offered to raise him.
                    </p>
                    <div class="character-image-left">
                        <img src="../../img/foxblade_veteran.png" alt="Foxblade, Grizzled Veteran" class="character">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        As a child, Noboru was interested in medicine and worked a little under the tutelage of the
                        local doctor. He learned some medical skills and was happy with this chosen path. Nonetheless,
                        his grandfather, knowing his true heritage, wanted him to ascend the path of the warrior. Noboru
                        resented his grandfather for pushing him in this direction. His grandfather was harsh about it,
                        and he eventually began learning more about how to fight and less about medicine. When he came
                        of age, Noboru was sent off to an academy to learn the ways of a warrior. It was during this
                        time he adopted the name Foxblade as his "warrior name".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon his return to his home island, Foxblade found the whole place burning to the ground.
                        Everyone and everything on the once peaceful island was dead and destroyed. It all had been done
                        at the hands of one of the lackeys of Blackfox, who at the time was the Champion of Ragnarok.
                        After fighting and defeating the henchman, he was left with a cursed wound. He went back to the
                        mainland to receive medical attention for this wound. At the hospital, he met a young magical
                        student from a local magic academy by the name of Morris Mouskawicz that dispelled the curse. He
                        was studying magical history, particularly that of the once great kitsune of Casarok. Noticing
                        something special about the young warrior, Morris brought Foxblade to an old kitsune shrine.
                        It was at this location that Foxblade attained his favored sword, the Inori Subarashi. This
                        katana was forged by the Inori kitsune family and branded with a rune such that only kitsune
                        could wield it. It was in this manner that Foxblade learned of his true heritage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the years that followed, Foxblade and Morris would travel the world to complete the Eight
                        Trials. Foxblade would earn his nine tails and Morris would document the whole trip for his own
                        personal studies. Along the way they assembled a crew that would follow along on their journey
                        for various reasons. In the end, Foxblade would become a true nine-tailed kitsune. Blackfox,
                        after much antagonizing of the young kitsune during his travels, reached out to him at this time
                        and enticed Foxblade with more power. Blackfox offered him a role beside him fighting for
                        Ragnarok as something monumental was about to happen. Foxblade refused and his group escaped the
                        clutches of the dark Champion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Suddenly, everything had become much different for the young kitsune warrior. His group
                        attempted to thwart the beginning of the War of the Gods. They failed to do so in the end.
                        Regardless, it is said that Foxblade ultimately defeated Blackfox near the start of the war.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Foxblade eventually lent his skills to <a href="pyrrhe.html">Pyrrhe Drake</a> and his mercanary
                        group, the Beasts of the Blade. Rather than taking a key role among the band of mercenaries, he
                        instead offered to help train others. Once in a while, he would involve himself in a fight as
                        the War of the Gods raged on and the Great Cataclysm occurred. For the most part, he took a
                        back seat and let the others write the history books instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the War of the Gods ended, Foxblade was instrumental to reintroducing the kitsune to
                        Casarok. Devoid of their divine power, he helped the rest of the kitsune adapt to their lives in
                        the new Casarok.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Foxblade's death is undocumented. It seems that he completely disappeared from the history books
                        as the kitsune repopulated their species in Casarok. As a nine-tailed kitsune, he was immortal.
                        However, it is unknown if that power remained extended to him or if he became mortal again as
                        the rest of the kitsune were.
