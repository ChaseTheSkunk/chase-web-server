                    <p>
                        <strong>Full name:</strong> Viktor Grasley<br>
                        <strong>Species:</strong> Turkey Vulture (<em>Cathartes aura</em>)<br>
                        <strong>Gender:</strong> Male<br>
                        <strong>Age:</strong> 45<br>
                        <strong>Height:</strong> 4' 2" (1.27 m)<br>
                        <strong>Occupation:</strong> Salesman<br>
                        <strong>Favorite Color:</strong> Green<br>
                        <strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Poultry<br>
                        <strong>Likes:</strong> money, fancy suits, social interaction<br>
                        <strong>Dislikes:</strong> spending, stubborn people, his own baldness
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                        Vick, if anything, is extremely persistent. He will almost never give up on making a sale once
                        he makes his initial pitch. In truth he becomes akin to a stereotypical salesperson, turning
                        on the charm and using a different tone of voice when he speaks to a potential customer. It
                        tends to come off as smarmy most of the time. This trait is demonstrated even more so when he
                        uses unethical or borderline illegal practices to make his sales. Because of his success rate,
                        Vick tends to show a little overconfidence and this extends to his everyday life. He is also
                        quite the penny pincher and hates to spend too much of his hard-earned money. Finally, he tries
                        to keep his baldness a secret by hiding his head under a hat or his toupee and will lose his
                        cool and his salesman charm if this secret is mistakenly revealed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                        Vick can and will eat anything. Although he prefers certain types of meats, he has very
                        corrosive stomach acid that allows him to digest nearly anything regardless of how old it may
                        be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Skills: </strong>
                        Vick is adept at selling anything to anyone. He has training from some of the best in the
                        business (although he ignores the ethics part of his training at times.) He also has some
                        experience operating various types of machinery.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Background:</strong>
                        Vick was born to a poor family with three other brothers and sisters. He was the oldest,
                        tallest, and strongest of them and was often able to fight his siblings for the scraps of food
                        his parents were able to put together for their children. While growing up, he learned from his
                        father the necessity and value of the dollar; in fact, he was taught that every cent was
                        important and should be kept close. As a young child, he became incredibly stingy with his
                        money, never loosening his grip on his meager savings even into his teenage years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vick eventually went to business school, working his way through since his parents could not
                        afford to send him there. His instructors saw him as a remarkable talent and took him under
                        their wing. He learned much under their tutelage and made his way through school with flying
                        colors. However, instead of following their advice and opting to extend his education to
                        achieve an MBA or the like, Vick left business school as soon as he graduated to begin his
                        career in sales. With the values taught to him by his father held in high regard, he decided it
                        was best to enter the sales business and start making money as quickly as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The life of a salesman suited him well. He started off taking individual jobs and flourishing
                        with them. He makes more in commissions than your average salesperson, and his talents caught
                        the eye of many companies. He could have become the greatest of the greats; however, people
                        started turning him down for more high quality positions when they learned of his seedy and
                        often unethical business practices. Regardless, he is still a skilled freelancer and makes a
                        healthy living. His living conditions are intentionally meager nevertheless in his ongoing
                        efforts to save as much money as possible. His success only seemed to make him stingier. He
                        would refuse to lend funds even to his lesser fortunate brothers and sisters. The lessons his
                        father once tried to instill upon him only continue to fuel his massive greed.
