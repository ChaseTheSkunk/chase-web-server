                        <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                        Jay's calling in life is to take to the skies. He is fascinated by flying and became a pilot,
                        owning his own biplane for joy rides. He's a pleasant person to be around with a his upbeat
                        personality, despite the fact that he mostly prefers to be solitary and doesn't have many
                        friends. Jay has a competitive streak to him, however. He hates to lose and, on the rare
                        occasion, will resort to cheating to get his way. His competitiveness is at its peak when he is
                        in an air race or following one of his favorite sports teams. Jay is a serious sports fanatic
                        and follows a lot of major sports in his country. It's part of what makes him a true patriot;
                        he loves his country and would do anything for it.

                        Jay has superior eyesight. He can spot the smallest details from a great distance. He's also

                        <strong>Skills: </strong>
                        Jay is a better than average pilot. He can do some tricky maneuvers no matter what type of plane
                        he is flying.

                        <strong>Background:</strong>
                        Jay was born to his parents in a small town and grew up as an only child. At a young age, he
                        became fascinated with flying. Science and history were his favorite subjects in school, mostly
                        because they had the most to do with aviation. He also took an interest in sports while in
                        school. He played several different games during his academic career and excelled at them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During his young life, he met <a href="chase.html">Chase</a>. While Jay wasn't much for making
                        friends, the two were both fairly isolated in their young lives for various reasons and that
                        brought them together. Jay learned about Chase's transformation abilities and immediately began
                        to imagine the possibilities of them. It dawned on him right away that the fox could turn into
                        creatures of flight and ultimately grew very attached to him. The two would sneak off and go on
                        flights together with Chase carrying Jay on his back in various forms. Jay loved every moment of
                        their flights together. However, Chase and his parents moved away after only a year or so after
                        they met. The two became separated and never heard from each other after that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jay became somewhat of a loner after Chase's departure. He met a lot of people through sports as
                        he grew up, and they helped him break out of his shell a little. His prowess in some of the
                        games he played earned him scholarships to various colleges. However, the call of the skies were
                        ultimately too great for him. He enrolled in flight school right after his education was
                        complete. Needless to say, Jay passed with flying colors. He would go on to train further and
                        become a commercial pilot in his everyday life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As fate would have it, Jay was chartered one day to fly <a href="ruby.html">Ruby</a> and her
                        colleagues to a remote location for an archaeological expedition. Among the crew was none other
                        than Chase, acting as Ruby's partner. The two instantly recognized each other, and smiles
                        brightened their faces as their old friendship became rekindled. Jay and Chase would go on to
                        remain good friends once again
