                    <p>
                        <strong>Full name:</strong> Cameron Leone<br>
                        <strong>Species:</strong> Veiled chameleon (<em>Chamaeleo calyptratus</em>)<br>
                        <strong>Gender:</strong> Female<br>
                        <strong>Age:</strong> 26<br>
                        <strong>Height:</strong> 3' 5" (1.04 m)<br>
                        <strong>Occupation:</strong> Artist<br>
                        <strong>Favorite Color:</strong> Green<br>
                        <strong>Favorite Food:</strong> Fancy hors d'oeuvres<br>
                        <strong>Likes:</strong> art, sunlight, formal gatherings<br>
                        <strong>Dislikes:</strong> bugs, darkness, critics
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                        Cameron loves her job. She is a prolific painter and sculptor and enjoys doing new pieces for
                        her employers and friends. She's very proud of the work she does too and displays some of her
                        own works of art in her private studio. Cameron doesn't like to have her art critiqued, however.
                        Being a young artist, this is a part of her job she still has yet to overcome if she's going to
                        make it big in the industry. She has a lazy side to her personality as well. It shows a bit in
                        her physique as she does not exercise very much and is chubbier than most other lizard Anthros.
                        Nevertheless, she is a good and loyal friend to those around her. She expects people to treat
                        her much the way she treats others, kind and generous but not to a fault.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                        As a chameleon, Cameron can change the color of her skin. This effect is often not radically
                        different from her normal color (she won't change bright pink, example) and is sometimes done
                        unintentionally. She also has a narrow tongue that can lash out quickly and stick to small
                        objects or large surfaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Skills: </strong>
                        Cameron is good with the tools of her trade. She has mastery over the paintbrush and chisel.
                        She even has some knowledge of paints infused with magic and can utilize them in various
                        situations. Her skills at talking with people, especially during formal occasions, are very
                        good as well.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Background:</strong>
                        Cameron has led a fairly easy life. She was born to a relatively normal family and has a younger
                        brother. She was always pretty average at her schoolwork, instead preferring to socialize with
                        others. The one place she did excel and find most of her passion in was with art class. She was
                        skilled with tools of her trade even at an early age. Still, her younger brother was the one who
                        always took home all the accolades as a scholar. She was and continues to be a little jealous of
                        him for his intellect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When she graduated from high school, Cameron went to art school to perfect and hone her skills.
                        She flourished in art school, yet her parents never truly acknowledged her impressive artistic
                        capabilities. She remained in the shadow of her younger brother. However, it no longer bothered
                        her as much. Her instructors and peers gave her all the recognition she needed and deserved. She
                        graduated from art school with flying colors (no pun intended) and set off to her first job as
                        an artist for a small company. After a few years under the guise of another artist, she decided
                        to open up her own studio and do freelance work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cameron's work got the attention of some worthwhile investors, and she began to cement her spot
                        in the industry. She was invited to some rather fancy art events, and it didn't take her long
                        to appreciate the culture and adopt the mannerisms that her sometimes wealthy clients expect of
                        her. She's by no means the top artist in the world, but even at such a young age she can hold
                        her own.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During one such art event, she met <a href="malichi.html">Malichi</a>, who has a taste for
                        formal gatherings himself. Cameron saw her little brother in the mouse machinist, and the two
                        became good friends. Eventually, she would go on to meet the rest of his friends and become a
                        part of <a href="chase.html">Chase</a>'s social circle. Being the social person she is, Cameron
                        had no trouble becoming good friends with them all, particularly with
                        <a href="ruby.html">Ruby</a> and <a href="katrina.html">Katrina</a>, who all like to hang out
                        together once in a while.
