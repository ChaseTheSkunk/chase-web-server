                        <strong>Other names:</strong> Bláthnaid O'Rodagh<br>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                        Azalea exudes confidence. She has belief in herself that she can accomplish any task set before
                        her. In fact, she will rarely turn down an opportunity because of her self-confidence. Her faith
                        in her abilities is so great that she even joined the Beasts of the Blade in order to take on
                        the gods of Casarok themselves! Perhaps she can be a little overconfident though. Azalea is also
                        a helpless flirt. She likes using her beauty and looks to flirt with men. These actions are
                        mostly a tease though as she will often use them to her advantage and lure others into a false
                        sense of security. It's mostly a game to her in this manner. She is also fiercely loyal to her
                        family and friends. Azalea would drop everything she was doing in order to attemot to help those
                        she loves no matter the cost.

                        <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                        Being raised by <a href="../world/bestiary/draicinne.html">draicinne</a>, they taught her the
                        powers of nature. She learned the power to control and manipulate plant life under their
                        tutliage. She can force plants to grow, increase their tensile strength, and allow them to adorn
                        new features such as thorns or briars. Any plant can become a strong enough weapon or armor
                        under her control. Her nature magic includes spells such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Entangling Roots: Azalea can summon roots from a nearby plant source to ensnare a target
                                and keep their body trapped in one spot.
                            </li>
                            <li>Whip of Thorns: Azalea can force a vine to grow thorns and use it as a whip.</li>
                            <li>Bullet Seed: Azalea can fire off seeds with explosive power in a general direction. They
                                often have the power of a small bullet. Multiple seeds are often used at once to create
                                a shotgun-like effect.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Skills: </strong>
                        Azalea is a brilliant swordswoman. Using the ironvine bracelets around her wrists, she is even
                        capable of wielding four swords at once. She is also keen when it comes to identifying plants in
                        the wild, a key survival skill.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Story:</strong>
                        Azalea's parents fled into <a href="../world/geography.html">Eldwood Forest</a> after her birth
                        for reasons unknown. Her parents never survived the forest; the cause of their deaths is
                        unknown, but any of the many treacherous dangers of the forest there could have caused their
                        demise. Azalea was found by a clan of draicinne within the forest and cared for as one of their
                        own.
                    </p>
                    <div class="character-image-left">
                        <img src="../../img/azalea_armored.png" alt="Azalea in Full Armor" class="character">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        For her entire childhood, she learned the ways of the draicinne of the forest. This particular
                        clan was strict vegetarians and users of natural magics. They also taught her swordsmanship, so
                        she may be able to defend herself. Azalea was a quick learner. As she grew up, she would even
                        become a guardian of the clan in her teen years. However, her confidence almost got the best of
                        her in some cases as she was almost killed on several occasions among the forest's many dangers.
                        Regardless of what happened, she would always arise triumphant or survive the fight by the skin
                        of her teeth. It toughened her up and taught her the limits of her own abilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the age of 16, she left Eldwood Forest on her own adventure. The world called out to her, and
                        she wanted to see what life was like beyond the dangers of the forest. Before parting with her
                        draicinne family, they gifted her the Ceithre Lanna na Foraoise (the Four Blades of the Forest)
                        to help her defend herself in the outside world. These were four shortswords crafted using
                        magical emeralds and the special forging techniques of the draicinne. Being a survivalist and
                        wielder of potent nature magics, she spent a lot of time on her own initially.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually she lent her skills with the sword to a group of mercenaries. It was with this group
                        that she was first given the Commonized name Azalea Swiftpaw from her original name of
                        Bláthnaid O'Rodagh given to her by her adoptive draicinne parents. There was plenty of work for
                        these mercenaries to do given that she was alive during the <a href="../world/history.html">
                        Cataclysmic Era</a>. Monsters and brigands roamed fairly freely during this time. Azalea would
                        eventually leave the band of mercenaries and freelance for a while. She liked having all the
                        gold from her various jobs to herself. After a few years of slaying monsters, thieves, and
                        various never-do-wells, Azalea grew bored.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        WHen she turned 19, Azalea heard about the Beasts of the Blade. She heard they were aiming to
                        end the War of the Gods and wanted to indulge in the ultimate challenge. She applied directly
                        with <a href="pyrrhe.html">Pyrrhe Drake</a> and immediately impressed him. Even with his
                        massive strength, the small vixen fought him to a stalemate. That was when he realized she was
                        somplething special. She joined up with the new band of mercenaries and quickly rose up through
                        the ranks. Eventually, Azalea became Pyrrhe's right-hand woman and second-in-command of the
                        Beasts of the Blade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Azalea would join Pyrrhe and the others on various quests to slay the gods and goddesses that
                        had aligned themselves with <a href="../world/pantheon.html">Ragnarok</a> in an attempt to bring
                        about all life on Casarok. Azalea faced many challenges during this time, but she overcame most
                        of them. WHen the Great Cataclysm tore the world asunder, Azalea grew worried about her
                        draicinne family back in the forest and nearly left the Beasts of the Blade to make sure they
                        were safe. Pyrrhe and <a href="foxblade.html"></a> instead convinced her to stay; the
                        mercenaries were her family now, and they needed her more than ever at that time. Azalea stayed
                        on as a mercenary in the group up until the end of the War. Although she did not accompany
                        Pyrrhe during the final battle, she was pivotal in many of the fights leading up to that point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the War Azalea pledged to help the rebuilding of the world. She taught others her farming
                        and gardening techniques and used her magic to help grow food for the shattered population. Her
                        rare skills witht he sword would not be passed down, unfortunately, except to those members of
                        the Beasts of the Blade whom she tutored. She eventually enshrined the Ceithre Lanna na Foraoise
                        so that they may never be used again and retired from the mercenary life to settle down to a
                        more modest life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Azalea passed away in the year 1023 CE during the Recovery Age at the age of 56.
