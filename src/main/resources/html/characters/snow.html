                        <strong>Character Traits:</strong>
                        Snow has a jovial personality. He loves to laugh and joke around with his friends. However, he
                        has a poor sense of humor and tends to tell bad jokes and puns. His humor does help him get
                        through difficult situations though. Snow is very hardy and can tolerate a lot, physically and
                        mentally. This trait is especially helpful being as stubborn as he is. An easy way to get on
                        his bad side is to start an argument over one of his core beliefs.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Abilities: </strong>
                        Like all skunks, Snow has the ability to spray. His spray is usually more powerful than other
                        skunks due to the special berries he eats. Snow is in possession of a basic runestone that
                        has some magic capabilities. He can call upon snow and wind as most runestones allow for;
                        however, it's other functionality has yet to be unveiled. Snow is also fairly athletic for his
                        size.

                        <strong>Skills: </strong>
                        Snow has deep knowledge of the <a href="../world/geography.html">Snowscape</a> and survival
                        tactics in such harshly cold areas.

                        <strong>Background:</strong>
                        Snow was born in a small polar skunk village in the Snowscape of northern Casarok, the older of
                        two brothers in his family. Shortly after the birth of his younger brother, his father abandoned
                        his family to travel the world. He was never seen in the Snowscape again. While his mother
                        worked, Snow and his brother were mostly raised by other family members in the village. Snow did
                        his best to mentor his younger brother as the acting man of the household. Eventually he took up
                        his mother's craft as well and grew to become a master candy maker. Nevertheless, he always
                        wondered what happened to his father, yet his familly would not let him leave the village in
                        search of him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everything changed for Snow the day that <a href="ruby.html">Ruby</a> arrived at his village.
                        The archaeologist wanted a guide to take her through an old polar skunk temple in the mountains.
                        No one in the small village would volunteer to help the strange kangaroo except for the teenage
                        Snow. Although everyone bade him not to aid her, Snow saw this as his best opportunity to leave
                        town in search of his lost dad. They set out together along with her crew into the mountains,
                        and he acted well as her guide through the harsh, cold environment. Ruby agreed to bring Snow
                        back to Centralia with her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Snow stayed with Ruby for a while until he could make a new life for himself. He found a job as
                        a candy maker, rented a small apartment for himself, and moved out of her home shortly after
                        leaving his small town in the Snowscape. Through his friendship with Ruby, he met
                        <a href="malichi.html">Malichi</a> and <a href="chase.html">Chase</a>. He often finds himself
                        sharing some of his candy with his fellow sweet-toothed mephit. Snow receives plenty of care
                        packages from his family back in the Snowscape and flies back to visit them every year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often, Snow can be found doing searches on the Internet, at the library, and in local archives
                        in search of some sign of his long lost his father. His whereabouts are still unknown to this
                        day, but Snow keeps his hopes up and stubbornly continues his search.
