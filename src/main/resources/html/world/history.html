                    <p>
                        Casarok has a long and storied history. Modern historians have categorized the history of the
                        world into three eras made up of various ages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Creation Era</strong> represents the earliest existence of the planet and its
                        inhabitants prior to around 10,000 BCE when the first intelligent life was known to exist.
                        During this era the universe, planetary system, and Casarok itself was created by the will of
                        <a href="pantheon.html">the gods and goddesses</a>. They also placed the primordials throughout
                        the world in this era. Fossils from this time are extremely sought after as they provide the
                        only palpable knowledge of this time period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <strong>Pre-Cataclysmic Era</strong> <em>(about 10,000 BCE - 1,000 CE)</em> is the earliest
                        known time of intelligent life on the planet. All of the native modern
                        <a href="races.html">races of Casarok</a> appeared on the planet during time in one manner or
                        another. The pantheon of Casarok was particularly active during this time as they all were
                        slain, fell out of favor, or no longer took an active role in the events of the world after the
                        end of this era. The majority of the history of this era is lost; nevertheless, that which is
                        known about this time has been divided into several ages:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Draconic Age</strong>: <em>(about 10,000 - 6,000 BCE)</em> Primordial dragons
                            evolved into the intelligent species of the Draconic race.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Iron Age</strong>: <em>(6,000 - 3,000 BCE)</em> The emergence of the Aspect and
                            Anthro races occurred during this age. Bronze and iron tools were developed and used to
                            enslave the weaker Anthro race.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Rebellion Age</strong>: <em>(3,000 - 1,000 BCE)</em> The Anthro species, having
                            grown in number from the previous age, won their independence from the stronger races. Most
                            Anthros became free during this time.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Magical Age</strong>: <em>(1,000 - 200 BCE)</em> The Anthro race made great
                            improvements in their use of magic.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Empirical Age</strong>: <em>(200 BCE - 500 CE)</em> The world was divided into many
                            large and powerful empires. (Similar to the Roman era of Earth history.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Crusade Age</strong>: <em>(500 - 600 CE)</em> A large culture spread resulting from
                            the fall of the great empires. The Common language became popularized during this age due to
                            this distribution of influence and culture.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Feudal Age</strong>: <em>(600 - 900 CE)</em> Casarok was once again controlled by
                            massive entities, this time in the form of kingdoms. However, they practiced diplomacy
                            rather than waging border wars. (Similar to the same age of human history.)
                        </li>
                        <li><a id="cataclysmic-age">
                            <strong>Cataclysmic Age</strong>: <em>(900 - 1000 CE)</em> The War of the Gods occurred in
                            which the gods and goddesses fought over the coming of the Endtimes, the destruction of all
                            life on Casarok. A great earthquake split the singular landmass into continents. Those
                            mortals that did survive were left in a crumbled civilization. The Aspect species lost
                            their magical abilities by the end of this era.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        With the land of the world split into six continents, the <strong>Post-Cataclysmic Era</strong>
                        <em>(1000 CE and onward)</em> began. Aside from one incident early in this age, the world was
                        devoid of the influence of the gods and goddesses of Casarok. All advancement was left to the
                        intelligent races of the world. A strict record of history has been kept ever since the end of
                        the War of the Gods. This age of history is divided into several ages:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Recovery Age</strong>: <em>(1000 - 1300 CE)</em> The survivors of the cataclysm
                            began to rebuild. Magical knowledge increased dramatically due to influence from the god of
                            magic, who was quickly banished from Casarok by the god of knowledge.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Enlightened Age</strong>: <em>(1300 - 1500 CE)</em> Technology fluorished and many
                            inventions were conceived. The two key advancements being steam and clockwork machinery.
                            The people of Casarok became enraptured by steampunk culture.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Expansion Age</strong>: <em>(1500 - 1700 CE)</em> Nations formed and began to
                            grow into their more modern boundaries. Thorough exploration and mapping of the new
                            continents occurred. (This is similar to the exploration and colonial portions of Earth
                            history.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Industrial Age</strong>: <em>(1700 - 1800 CE)</em> Steam and clockwork technology
                            gave way to fossil fuels and electricity. Many factories were formed. (Mirrors the same age
                            of human history.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Machination Age</strong>: <em>(1800 BCE - 1900 CE)</em> More advances in technology
                            occurred. Mage-tech, the union of magic and machines, was invented. Mechanized weapons
                            became common and the world became engulfed in war. (Similar to the time of the world wars
                            in human history.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Modern Age</strong>: <em>(1900 - 2100 CE)</em> Magical and technological advances
                            continued and a tentative peace was kept through the world.
                            <a href="../characters/chase.html">Chase</a> and his friends live during this time. (Similar
                            to modern times on Earth but with more advanced technology.)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Space Age</strong>: <em>(2100 - 2300 CE)</em> The people of Casarok begin exploring
                            their planetary system and discovering various alien races. Personal space travel becomes
                            inexpensive, and colonies are formed on uninhabited planets.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Light Age</strong>: <em>(2300 CE and beyond)</em> Light-speed travel becomes
                            possible. Casarok nears the pinnacle of most technological advances and must frontier to
                            the depths of the universe to push their limits further.
