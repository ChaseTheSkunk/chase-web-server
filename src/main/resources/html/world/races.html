                    <p>
                        Life on Casarok takes many different forms. The intelligent species are divided into three races
                        while the rest of sentient life has their own set of three classifications.

                        The <strong>Anthros</strong> are the most common and diverse race of intelligent creatures in
                        Casarok. They have the highest population and number of species among the three races. All
                        members of this race are anthropomorphic animals. (In Casarok, this word means like an Anthro
                        rather than human-shaped.) Most species that make up this race correspond to a species of animal
                        found on Earth; however, there are some species that are native only to Casarok. Anthros are
                        capable of learning magic, though in extremely exceptional cases they can use divine magic.

                        The <strong>Aspects</strong> are the intelligent race of Casarok created to be the avatars of
                        the gods and goddesses. One species exists for each god or goddess and each one is based on an
                        Earth mythological creature. They all possess unique qualities that can be used to discern them
                        from Anthros. For example, avian Aspects have wings on their backs while Anthros have wing-arms.
                        All species are anthropomorphic except for centaurs, wemics, and merfolk. Each species of the
                        Aspect race has magic powers based on their matron or patron deity. They are capable of learning
                        magic, but it is difficult for them to learn abilities that do not align with their matron or
                        patron deity.

                        The <strong>Draconic</strong> race is the least common and diverse of Casarok's three races.
                        There are only seven total species in this race and only six that exist throughout the
                        majority of Casarok's history. As designated by the name of their race, each species is a form
                        of dragon. All species are anthropomorphic save for two which are quadrupedal. They are born
                        with a strict set of magical abilities, gifted to them by the
                        <a href="pantheon.html">gods and goddesses of Casarok</a> early in the history of the world.
                        Although they have an innate set of magical abilities, they cannot learn any new spells.

                        <strong>Feral</strong> is the classification for all non-magical non-intelligent creatures that
                        naturally evolved from the primordial beings of the Creation Era. Many feral species are docile
                        and capable of domestication. Some can be kept as pets. Others are farmed for meat, dairy
                        products, or labor. Several others are hunted for meat, scales, hide, and other resources.

                        <strong>Monster</strong> is the classification for all creatures that evolved from primordials
                        through the planet's magic. Most of them are non-intelligent, but this fact is debatable for
                        some species. They are generally hostile or dangerous and not tamable. They can be hunted for
                        much the same reason as ferals, but this is usually not done outside of necessity or sport. In
                        more modern times, magical wards keep monsters out of populated areas.

                        <strong>Floradon</strong> is the classification for all highly evolved plant-based life in
                        Casarok. They are the accidental creations of the gods Tempatrius and Domathair. Some species
                        are magical in nature while others are purely bestial. Some can be domesticated and kept as pets
                        while others are as dangerous as the most dangerous monsters. Those floradons that are not
                        poisonous can be hunted for food.
