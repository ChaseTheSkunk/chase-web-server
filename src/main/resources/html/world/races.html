                    <p>
                        Life on Casarok takes many different forms. The intelligent species are divided into three races
                        while the rest of sentient life has their own set of three classifications.

                        The <strong>Anthros</strong> are the most common and diverse race of intelligent creatures in
                        Casarok. They have the highest population and number of species among the three races. All
                        members of this race are anthropomorphic animals, hence the name given to them. (The majority
                        of them can be found in their feral variants on planet Earth, but there are a few species that
                        are native only to Casarok.)

                    <p>
                        The <strong>Aspects</strong> are the intelligent race of Casarok created to be the avatars of
                        the gods and goddesses. One species exists for each god or goddess. They usually possess
                        unique qualities that separate them from their Anthro brethren. For example, avian Aspects
                        have wings on their backs while Anthros have wing-arms. All species are anthropomorphic except
                        for centaurs, wemics, and merfolk. Each species of the Aspect race has magic powers based on
                        their matron or patron deity. (Each species is a mythological or fantasy creature.)

                        The <strong>Draconic</strong> race is the least common and diverse of Casarok's three races.
                        There are only seven total species in this race and only six that exist throughout the
                        majority of Casarok's history. All species are anthropomorphic save for two which are
                        quadrupedal. They are born with a strict set of magical abilities, gifted to them by the
                        <a href="pantheon.html">gods and goddesses of Casarok</a> early in the history of the world.

                        <strong>Feral</strong> is the classification for all non-magical non-intelligent creatures that
                        evolved from the primordials. Many species in the feral classification have been domesticated.
                        Several others are hunted for meat and other resources, though laws in the modern age prevent
                        them from being overhunted.

                        <strong>Monster</strong> is the classification for all magical creatures, almost all of which
                        have been deemed dangerous or extremely hostile. They are generally unable to be tamed and
                        difficult to fight. Most of the populace considers them such a threat that there are rarely ever
                        laws restricting them from being hunted.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Floradon</strong> is the classification for all highly evolved plant-based life in
                        Casarok. They are creations of the gods Tempatrius and Domathair that are highly threatening,
                        some nearly on par with the monsters of the world. Some are magical in nature while others are
                        strictly bestial. A few of them, however, are docile and kept as pets similarly to some feral
                        creatures.

                        All alien and unclassified lifeforms are categorized as <strong>Xenoids</strong>. There are many
                        different subclassifications for this set of creatures.
