                    <p>
                        The planet is split fairly evenly between land and water at about 50% of the surface area for
                        each. Practically all biomes exist on land from plains and forests to deserts and tundra. There
                        are also wastelands on the land, areas of Casarok where few plants, ferals, or even anthros can
                        survive. Underwater creatures live in separate biomes. For example there are sandbars, coral
                        reefs, kelp forests, continental shelves, submarine volcanoes, and the extreme depths. Certain
                        types of creature thrive in each type of biome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The map of the world is split between pre-Cataclysm and post-Cataclysm. Before the
                        <a href="history.html#cataclysmic-age">Cataclysmic Age</a>, there was only one landmass. The
                        land formed one large Pangaea-like continent. After the Great Cataclysm struck, the landmass was
                        split into the six continents: (from north to south) the Snowscape, Sequia, Centralia, Euraline,
                        Phaerolis, and Frostland. Both maps, along with major landmarks in the world, can be seen below.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Origin Mountain</strong>: At the very center of the continent, it is the largest
                            peak in the world. It marks 0-degrees latitude and 0-degrees longitude for all Casarokan
                            cartographers. The mountain is home to some of Casarok's most dangerous creatures but is
                            said to hold great secrets about the world.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Eldwood Forest</strong>: The thick forest that surrounds Origin Mountain. Many
                            dangerous creatures lie within, especially many hostile
                            <a href="races.html#floradon">floradons</a>. A powerful clan of owlbeast Aspects live here
                            as well, guarding the forest from intruders.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The Snowscape</strong>: The arctic tundra that covers all of northern Casarok.
                            After the Great Cataclysm, it split off into its own continent. All creatures in this area
                            of the world are adapted to the extreme cold that occurs during the winter months.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>King's Crown</strong>: The area of the Snowscape that has formed glaciers and fjords
                            at the very northernmost point of the world. The very tip on the center peninsula is known
                            as King's Crown Point.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The Frostland</strong>: The antarctic tundra of southern Casarok. It became its own
                            continent after the Great Cataclysm as well. A clan of frost dragons are said to live here
                            that house the Great Library. The whereabouts of this landmark are unknown, but it is said
                            to contain all the history of Casarok that was lost from the Pre-Cataclysmic Era.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Breior Mountains</strong>: The longest mountain range in all of Casarok. It divides
                            the Snowscape from the central and eastern parts of the world. Until modern times, it was
                            very treacherous crossing over these mountains due to the sheer height and powerful
                            creatures that inhabited some areas.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Sha Zur Mountains</strong>: A smaller mountain range that extends south from the
                            Breior mountains. It acts as a natural divider between central and eastern Casarok.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>The Firelands</strong>: A small wasteland area nestled in the corner between the
                            Breior and Sha Zur Mountains. Very few creatures live here, but some
                            <a href="bestiary/dracamma.html">dracammas</a> and salamander Aspects can live in this area
                            for example.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Mount Coreptus</strong>: A large volcano that marks an area of high volcanic
                            activity at the western end of the Breior mountains. It is said to have been a major
                            catalyst in the Great Cataclysm. The area around this mountain is home to a strong clan of
                            dracammas.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Acaraho Mountains</strong>: A small mountain range in western Casarok. A lush
                            rainforest sits between the mountains and the ocean that is known to be some of the best
                            hunting grounds on land.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Khulu Jungle</strong>: A tropical jungle in central western Casarok. It is the
                            largest such area in the world.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Cat's Head Island</strong>: A large island that sits in the cape of southwestern
                            Casarok. It is a mostly peaceful area, and many anthros call this place home.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Escanina Islands</strong>: A small chain of tropical islands in central eastern
                            Casarok. The largest of these islands is known as Crescent Island. The name was given to
                            these islands because of the large canid population that lives there.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The Sandsprawl</strong>: The largest desert in Casarok, located in the southeastern
                            portion of the world. After the Great Cataclysm, it spread out and became an even larger
                            part of Phaerolis. Despite the harsh environment, it gave way to some of the strongest
                            empires in the world.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The Deadly Steppes</strong>: The wasteland area near or surrounded by the
                            Sandsprawl, depending on the time in history. It is said to be one of the deadliest areas in
                            all of Casarok. Extremely few creatures can survive the harsh environment.
                        </li>
