                        <p>
                            Before the <a href="../history.html#cataclysmic-age">Great Cataclysm</a>, there were
                            differing stories about how the sun and moon moved across the sky every day. One such tale
                            was told by the followers of <a href="../pantheon.html">Phoenicia</a>, the phoenix goddess
                            of the sun. The other was told by the followers of <a href="../pantheon.html">Mohiga</a>,
                            the werewolf goddess of the moon. These stories carried on through the ages as mythology to
                            those who no longer believe in the old gods.
                        </p>

                            <strong>From the side of the followers of Phoenicia</strong><br>
                            The sun goddess rises from her slumber every morning and flies across the daytime skies. No
                            one would defy her daily rite except for the occasional resistance from the storm goddess.
                            The cloud god would aid her across the sky everyday and protect her from sight when she
                            deemed fit. Flying across the sky and providing light to the world is a tiresome task,
                            however, even for someone as mighty as the sun goddess. Every evening, she would disappear
                            over the horizon and sleep once again. The moon goddess would come out for her nightly hunt
                            at this time and stalk her way across the night sky. The moon goddess would cowardly run
                            and hide behind the horizon, nevertheless, as morning came. The sun goddess would always
                            rise again and chase off the moon goddess to begin the day anew. Sometimes the moon goddess
                            would not even show up for her nightly hunt; on the following day, the sun goddess -- not
                            needing to waste energy chasing off the cowardly moon goddess -- is able to bless her
                            followers with great power. Sometimes the moon goddess would show herself in full and shower
                            her followers with power, but this ritual is of no concern to the sun goddess. She is merely
                            run out of the sky every morning all the same...

                            <strong>From the side of the followers of Mohiga</strong><br>
                            It is said that every time the sky turns red, there is a great battle between the moon
                            goddess and the sun goddess. Every evening the moon goddess is triumphant and slays the sun
                            goddess. However a god cannot truly kill another god. Being a phoenix, the ashes of the sun
                            goddess reform into an egg. The egg of the sun goddess is the greatest trophy one can attain
                            from their hunt. The moon goddess hoists this trophy after her kill and parades it through
                            the night sky. It is a tremendous boon to her followers as she leads them on in the nightly
                            hunt. When the morning comes, the egg hatches and the moon and sun goddess fight anew. Of
                            course, the nightly hunt is tiring even for a goddess, so she disappears behind the horizon
                            to plan her next hunt and allows the sun goddess her daily ritual. It is a futile ritual,
                            however, as the moon goddess returns fully rested each evening and slays the sun goddess
                            anew. The more proudly the moon goddess carries the egg of the sun goddess, the more
                            powerful she becomes. On days when the egg is fully alight in the night sky, the followers
                            of the moon goddess are granted their greatest blessing. Regardless, when the egg appears at
                            its most ashen, the sun goddess rises stronger than ever on the follow morning and her
                            followers are blessed instead.
                        </p>

                            The conflicting stories tell much of the same events. First, they both explain that the two
                            goddesses are responsible for carrying their heavenly body throughout the sky every day.
                            Secondly, they both tell of how the followers of Phoenicia are exceptionally blessed the day
                            after a new moon occurs. Finally, the two tales describe how the followers of Mohiga gain a
                            particular boon during the nights of a full moon.
