                        <p>
                            <strong>Name:</strong> Peskara<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> PEH-skar-uh<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Anolis piscosus</em><br>
                            <strong>Race:</strong> Anthro<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3-4' (0.8-1.2 m)<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> None<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the peskara language, <em>pescado</em> meaning "fish" and <em>escala</em> meaning
                            "scale".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Peskaras look mostly like green lizards with blue-green scales over most of their bodies.
                            Their heads feature light blue frills or spines lining the top and back, and long, thick
                            snouts in front. Lighter green scales line the front of their torsos and the undersides of
                            their tails. The defining characteristic of the peskaras are their long, fish-like tails.
                            At the ends of their tails are shark-like fins. Additional fins can be found on their
                            forearms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            Peskaras are adept swimmers. Their lean hydrodynamic bodies, fins, and tail allows them to
                            swim through the water at fast speeds. They are also capable of holding their breath for
                            long periods of time. Peskara claws can be kept rather sharp as well, which are useful for
                            spearing fish or attacking threatening foes in combat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            The peskara population prefers living near rivers, lakes, and seas more than other
                            <a href="../races.html#anthro">Anthros</a>. Historically, they prefer small coastal
                            villages. In modern times, they can be found in cities near large bodies of water.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Peskaras are well-known for two things: their sailing ability and their armorsmithing
                            skills. Peskaras are historically known as good sailors. Whether they are piloting small
                            fishing boats, scouting ships, or wartime vessels, peskara sailors are known as some of the
                            best in the world. Peskara armorsmiths, on the other hand, are good at crafting scale mail
                            armor. Techniques for smithing such armor have been passed down among peskara families for
                            generations. Some of their rarest armor utilizes dragon scales. As far as magic goes, they
                            have a greater tendency to study elemental magic over the arcane or metaphysical. Despite
                            the fact that they are clearly aquatic in nature, the peskaras believe they are descended
                            from primordial dragons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Being mostly coastal, they have a preference for shellfish. However, they aren't against
                            eating fruit, small insects, or a normal Anthro diet as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            Peskaras used to speak their own language, which is similar to that of Earth Portuguese. As
                            with many Anthros, they adopted the Common language around the time of its creation.
