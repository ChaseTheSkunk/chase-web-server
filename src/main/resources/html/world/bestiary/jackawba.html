                            <strong>Name:</strong> Jackawba<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> JACK-ah-buh<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Canis vegrandis</em><br>
                            <strong>Classification:</strong> Monster<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 1.5-2' (0.46-0.61 m)<br>
                            <strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            Unknown
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Jackawbas are built like small dogs at roughly half the size of an average Anthro. Their fur
                            ranges from tan to dark brown usually with patches of darker colored fur on their heads,
                            chests, and the tips of their tails. Their muzzles are thin and bony with rows of sharp,
                            curved teeth lining the inside. Jackawbas also exhibit longer than normal ears for a
                            canine-like species. Their tails are long with uncharacteristically short fur up until the
                            tip of the tail where it grows very thick. A strange feature of jackawbas is their thick,
                            muscular forearms which are usually greater in circumference than their biceps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Jackawbas tend to live in rocky or arid areas. They are more rarely seen in prairies and
                            plains. They are even less often seen in wastelands, but they are capable of living in those
                            barren regions as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Jackawbas congregate in packs. Their social structure is akin to those of feral wolves in
                            which the strongest establish themselves as the alphas of their pack. They hunt together as
                            a pack. They will use their spatial magic to fire magic blasts at prey. If they come across
                            a larger prey creature, they will shrink it to a smaller size to make it easier to capture.
                            If they come across an Anthro, they are likely to surround it and use a similar technique to
                            capture them. Sometimes they will employ polymorph spells to make a normally less edible
                            creature easier to eat. Jackawbas have limited intelligence, but moreso than most other
                            monsters. They are known to create crude weapons in use for hunting and defense. They are
                            even capable of learning new spells when kept in captivity. When coming across other packs,
                            jackawbas will fight for territory. Rarely will two packs ever come together and combine
                            into one larger packs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Interactions:</strong>
                            Jackawbas do not provide much use to Anthro-kind. They are usually hunted to drive them off
                            from populated areas or because they pose a threat to local travelers. Some will hunt them
                            for minor alchemical ingredients such as their teeth or blood. Some will capture them and
                            keep them in captivity to learn more about them, mostly due to having higher intellect than
                            normal for a monster species.
