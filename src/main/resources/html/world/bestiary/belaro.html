                            <strong>Name:</strong> Belaro<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> BELL-ah-ro<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Felis crenarata</em><br>
                            <strong>Race:</strong> Anthro<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3-4' (0.8-1.2 m)<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> None<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            Unknown
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Belaros are mostly cat-like in appearance. They are easily separated from their other feline
                            counterparts by their ears; belaro ears are long and ornate with a distinctive notch toward
                            the middle. Their tails are not only generally long but also sport a notch toward the end.
                            Their fur tends to be monochromatic. They have a mostly white coat with black stripes along
                            their face, tail, forearms, and paws.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            Like most other felines, they have sharp, retractable claws on all their digits. Belaros
                            tend to be very skilled singers. In fact some of the most famous musical artists in the
                            world and throughout history have been of the belaro species. Some belaros mix magic with
                            their natural singing ability to cast unique spells.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Belaro population distribution does not tend to differ from that of other
                            <a href="../races.html#anthro">Anthros</a>. However, they do prefer large towns and cities
                            slightly more.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Belaros like beautiful things. As naturally distinguished singers, they like good music --
                            especially good singing voices. Even in their early history, musicians were held in high
                            regard by belaros. They lauded anyone with a better singing voice than they had. Belaros
                            also have an eye for shiny, glittering objects. Gold and jewelry is very popular with
                            belaros. The object they hold most dear to them, however, are bells. They enjoy adorning
                            themselves with cat bells and will usually hang them from the notches in their ears or tail.
                            A belaro's golden bell is usually their most prized possession. Historically, a belaro is
                            known to fight tooth-and-nail if their bell gets stolen.

                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Belaro diets do not tend to differ from other feline Anthro species. They tend to eat more
                            fish and poultry.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            Belaros have spoken Common since its inception. Before that, they would speak whichever
                            language was prominent in their local culture. In early history, some primarily belaro
                            establishments spoke their own language (a modified version of the Earth Italian language.)
