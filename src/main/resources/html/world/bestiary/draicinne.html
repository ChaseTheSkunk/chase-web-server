                            <strong>Name:</strong> Draicinne<br>
                            <strong>Other Names:</strong> Forest Dragon<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> drae-gin-AY<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Draco silvestris</em><br>
                            <strong>Race:</strong> Draconic<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3.5-4' (1-1.22 m)<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/nature.png" title="Nature" alt="Nature"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the language of the draicinni, <em>draic</em> meaning "dragon" and <em>inne</em>
                            meaning "nature".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Draicinni are covered in soft green fur over most of their bodies. Across their fronts are
                            thick scales colored more lightly than their fur. Their heads exhibit a short and bulbous
                            snout, thick pointed horns, and long ears. A mane of hair also adorns the tops of their
                            heads in between their horns. Draicinne tails are thin and have a wide range of motion. A
                            plume of green feathers sits at the ends of their tails which some says resemble leaves.
                            Their wings are feathery as well, and their wingspan greatly exceeds their armspan. They
                            are light and capable of flight when not wearing any heavy armor (a rarity for the mostly
                            nature-based race). Draicinni live longer than any other Draconic race with a life
                            expectancy of around 500 years.

                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            The draicinni breath ability calls upon pure natural energy. The breath attack is akin to
                            various nature magics but is not magical in itself. Aside from the usual Draconic breath
                            ability, they do wield a variety of nature magics. They are capable of calling upon nature's
                            wrath, controlling and manipulating plants, and envenoming foes with various natural toxins.
                            They are also capable of shapeshifting, allowing them to blend in with or adapt to their
                            current environment. They also tend to shapeshift to adapt to another creature's fighting
                            style. If fighting in the forest, they have a truly distinct advantage over almost any other
                            species or race.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Draicinni live primarily in forests and jungles. It is rare to see a draicinne outside of
                            a wooded area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Draicinni live in small villages or communes that are entirely self-sufficient. Each commune
                            harvests and hunts for all their own food. Trade is normally only done with other draicinne
                            communes since they are capable of growing anything. Communes each have a designated leader;
                            however, some communes have formed together in the past to form larger villages within the
                            forests. In such a case, each commune's leader maintains some power while the leader of the
                            largest commune oversees the others. Draicinni see themselves as the protectors of nature.
                            Thus they will question, capture, or outright attack anyone they see as a threat to the
                            forest or jungle they call home. However, not all draicinni are capable warriors. Those
                            soldiers who do protect the lands are known as wardens, and they are generally high-ranking
                            members of draicinne society.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Draicinni are omnivorous. While they prefer to feast on fruits and vegetables, they will
                            hunt on the rare occasion for meat or edible species of
                            <a href="../races.html#floradon">floradons</a>. They remain self-sustaining in this way
                            and do not accept food from other species or races.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            Old Irish used to be the language of choice for the draicinni. Eventually, their language
                            evolved over time. They did not begin to speak Common until late in the Crusade Age or
                            early in the Feudal Age. The exact date of this adoption is unknown.
