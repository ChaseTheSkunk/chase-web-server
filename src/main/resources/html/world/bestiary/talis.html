                        <p>
                            <strong>Name:</strong> Talis<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> TAL-iss<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Aeonarris spiritalis</em><br>
                            <strong>Race:</strong> Anthro<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3-4' (0.8-1.2 m)<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/spirit.png" title="Spirit" alt="Spirit"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From Dracammarum, short for <em>spiritalis</em> meaning "spiritual". They are also known as
                            the <em>Jīngshén de rén</em> -- meaning "Spiritual ones" -- in the east.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Talis are known primarily for their light purple fur. The actual hue of their fur does not
                            vary much between individuals. The fur is very thick and fluffy around their necks, another
                            distinguishing feature of their forms. The heads of talis generally have large, curved ears
                            and short muzzles with small nosepads. Their eyes differ in color among each other, but they
                            are all deeply colored. The tails of the talis are long and thin with a large tuft of
                            lighter colored fur at the end. The tuft is tipped white somewhat like that of a fox.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            The ears of the talis give them acute hearing. They can hear the slightest or the most
                            distant noises. Some have said that they can even hear the words of ghosts and spirits in
                            the world, though this has long been debunked as a myth. In addition, the talis have a fine
                            sense of touch on the tips of their tails. They become alert when someone or something
                            brushes against their tail tufts. The talis are also known to have an affinity for learning
                            spirit magics, although not all talis even learn from the metaphysical school or pick up
                            magic of any kind at all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Talis live mostly in the temperate climates of Casarok. They are more commonly found in the
                            western and eastern portions of the world, however. Some talis can be found in the northern
                            mountains as well, yet they do not cross into the <a href="../geography.html">Snowscape</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            The talis tend to live among other Anthros and pick up their local culture. Regardless of
                            the place they call home, talis tend to have great respect for those who are learned in the
                            ways of spirit magic. In the rare case that the talis create a community amongst themselves,
                            this aspect of their character is enhanced. The leader of a pure talis village is usually
                            the greatest spirit wizard. In fact, the hierarchy of some talis villages is determined by
                            knowledge of spirit magic. The talis of such communities are so attuned to spirit magic
                            that it is said their magical teachings rival those of even the
                            <a href="dmuundre.html">dmuun'dre</a>. Runes and symbols for spirit magic are popular and
                            adorn much of their clothing and weaponry. Talis that are not part of these communities will
                            sometimes make pilgrimages to these places. It is said to be a soul-cleansing experience,
                            especially for those of other species who decide to make the trek.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Talis diet differs depending on the region they are from; however, they are omnivorous like
                            much of the other Anthro race and eat a wide diversity of food.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            The talis speak a variety of languages, depending on region. In more modern times, they
                            speak the Common language.
