                            <strong>Name:</strong> Draklith<br>
                            <strong>Other Names:</strong> Earth Dragon<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> DRAK-lith<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Draco terrestris</em><br>
                            <strong>Race:</strong> Draconic<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> ~4' (~1.22 m)<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/earth.png" title="Earth" alt="Earth"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the language of the draklithoi, <em>drakon</em> meaning "dragon" and <em>lithos</em>
                            meaning "stone".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Draklithoi have rough scales covering most of their body, usually of a brown or golden tone.
                            The fronts of the necks and torsos bear large, thick, armor-like scales that help protect
                            vital organs from injury. On their heads are short, obtusely curved horns. Thick spines
                            line the backs of their necks. They lack outward-facing ears. Their snouts are pointed with
                            a short horn in the center, and the lower jaw bears jagged protrusions. The tails of the
                            draklithoi are long and muscular, which allows them to freely swing the hammer-like growth
                            at the ends of their tails. This growth is made up of much similar material to that of their
                            claws, which are short but hard enough to cut diamond. They have large wings as well;
                            however, they have limited flight capabilities due to their size and girth. Their flying
                            ability is often only used to hover over cliffs or ascend short distances up mountains.
                            Draklithoi have a lifespan of around 400 years.

                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            Draklithoi, similar to other Draconic species in Casarok, have a signature breath ability:
                            They are capable of breathing stoneskin breath, which can petrify an opponent caught within
                            its area of effect for a long enough time. Aside from that they are capable of wielding
                            earth magics. Among their powers are the abilities to conjure earthquakes, create stone
                            formations, and hurl stones and boulders at foes. They can also use their earth magic to
                            locate precious metals and gems buried underground. Physically, they are no slouches either.
                            They have strong, sturdy builds and a built-in hammer weapon on their tails.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Draklith live in rocky areas such as mountains, canyons, and cliffsides. Some draklithoi
                            live in desert and wasteland areas where food is scarcer for other living creatures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Draklithoi tend to live in caves, either natural or dug out themselves. In fact some
                            draklith clans build entire cities under mountains. They do this to remain reclusive as they
                            often don't like dealing with other species. When they do encounter other intelligent
                            species, they have a tendency to be stubborn and demanding. Clans and cities are often run
                            by the individual with the most precious metals and gems. It is common for a draklith to
                            hoard one's treasures in their private den as a result. The leader runs mining operations to
                            further their wealth while maintaining their constituencies. Jewelcrafting is a popular
                            pastime among draklithoi, and the gems they produce are highly sought after by the rest of
                            Casarok as valuable treasures. They have a tendency to walk and stand in a quadrupedal
                            stance, much different from the rest of the Draconic species in Casarok. However, they do
                            stand upright when confronting other species or fighting. Some draklithoi fashion braces
                            from stone or metal to help them stand on two legs in such cases.

                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Draklithoi are mainly petravorous, meaning they derive important nutrients and minerals from
                            rocks. They are known to hunt <a href="../races.html#feral">feral</a> game on occasion as
                            well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            The draklithoi spoke Ancient Greek at one point. The language evolved into modern Greek and
                            is still spoken by draklithoi to the modern day as a secondary language. They have adopted
                            the COmmon language since some time after its inception.
