                            <strong>Name:</strong> Alepod<br>
                            <strong>Other Names:</strong> Vivirga (Dracammarum)<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> AL-uh-pod<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Floradon praetrepidans</em><br>
                            <strong>Classification:</strong> Floradon<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3-6" (0.08-0.15 m)<br>
                            <strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/nature.png" title="Nature" alt="Nature"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the Common words <em>alert</em> and <em>pod</em>. Formerly known as Vivirga from the
                            Dracammarum words <em>vigilate</em> meaning "vigilant" and <em>virga</em> meaning "sprout".

                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Alepods come in a variety of colors and shapes, depending on the biome they come from.
                            Regardless of their location, they all share some similar qualities. The main body is
                            spherical or ovoid in shape. A thick but flexible stem allows them to wiggle and lean in
                            various directions and acts as their main method of motion. They all have three leafy
                            protrusions at the base of the stem, which seem to act like armlets. All alepods are rather
                            small at a half foot at their tallest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Alepods live in a variety of habitats. They are primarily found in forests, meadows, and
                            swamops.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Alepods usually grow in patches with dozens of other alepods of the same type. They remain
                            rooted in that same spot their entire lives. The sprout-like creatures are very skittish
                            and weary of predators. If they spot a potential threat, they let out a cry, pheromones, or
                            both in order to attract other <a href="../races.html#floradon">floradons</a> to protect
                            them. Larger patches of alepods are generally more successful in summoning other floradons
                            to their aid. Without the aid of more powerful floradons, however, alepods are rather
                            defenseless. They will bite at their attackers even though these efforts are often futile.
                            Alepods more commonly bite at insects that pass by though; they consist themselves mostly
                            off of photosynthesis, but they are capable of metabolizing small bugs and spiders for their
                            sustenance as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Interactions:</strong>
                            Most anthros will avoid alepods if they are encountered in the wild due to their ability to
                            attract more powerful creatures to them. Nevertheless, some hunters will use this ability
                            to their advantage. Alepods can be farmed for food as a plant-based protein source. They
                            are also bred for use as pets, usually kept like potted plants (as pictured, center) near a
                            window or some other light source or outdoors. It is usually imperative for farmers and
                            breeders of alepods to have some form of magical ward in the area to prevent the sprout-like
                            creatures from summoning other floradons to the area.
