                            <strong>Name:</strong> Drekaldr<br>
                            <strong>Other Names:</strong> Frost Dragon<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> dreh-KAL-der<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Draco frigoris</em><br>
                            <strong>Race:</strong> Draconic<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 4-5' (1.2-1.5 m)<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/frost.png" title="Frost" alt="Frost"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From Drekaldrish, <em>dreki</em> meaning "dragon" and <em>kaldr</em> meaning "cold".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Drekaldar are known for their primarily white scales which look almost like pure snow.
                            Light blue scales travel along their snout, neck, front of the torso, and underside. Blue
                            fur covers the tops of their heads and runs down the length of their back all the way to
                            the tips of their tails. Their heads feature two long, straight, deep blue horns that
                            resemble icicles. The snout bears a small horn at the very tip as well as large nostrils on
                            either side of the horn. Most drekaldar are heavy set and have a thick layer of fat around
                            their abdominal region. Only their warriors are slimmed down so as to keep in shape for
                            battle. The feet and hands are equipped with short but sharp claws that are capable of
                            picking through ice if needed. Drekaldr wings are small and light, making them incapable of
                            flight; however, they can fold these wings in a particular way on their backs to act like
                            a fin. Along with their natural buoyancy and their thick, muscular tails, they are adept at
                            swimming through frigid waters. The average lifespan of a drekaldr is 250 years.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            Drekaldar have frost breath as their primary weapon, able to chill their opponents. They
                            also wield potent frost magic and are easily capable of freezing others into solid blocks
                            of ice if the situation calls for it. Their magical kit also includes the ability to breathe
                            underwater. They have a tolerance for extreme cold and can survive in temperatures much
                            lower than any other creature in Casarok. Drekaldar are also extremely intelligent, making
                            them able to learn new things at an accelerated rate or strategize quickly on the
                            battlefield.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Drekaldar live in the polar regions of Casarok. They typically remain reclusive and will
                            live underground or underwater where other creatures would be hard-pressed to find them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Drekaldar are rational thinkers. They prioritize the pursuit of knowledge over barbarism and
                            fighting whenever possible. Their academic teachings are long sought after, and the
                            greatest Anthro universities in the world seek to employ the few drekaldar that leave their
                            homes. Their libraries are sought after as well, including the fabled Great Library that is
                            said to exist in the <a href="../geography.html">Frostlands</a>. However, they tend to
                            remain very reclusive and few drekaldar ever set foot too far outside their place of origin.
                            Because of their keen intellect and small numbers, their government is very well organized
                            and crime is at a minimum in drekaldr villages. During the long winter months some drekaldar
                            hibernate to reduce the need for food when it is at its most scarce.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            The drekaldar are primarily petravores, meaning they take in nutrients and minerals from the
                            consumption of rocks. They will construct traps for prey ferals and monsters to use for
                            meat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            The primary language historically was Old Norse, which evolved into Drekaldrish over time.
                            Usually only those drekaldar that venture out from their homes learn Common, but there can
                            be one or two Common translators depending on the village. Due to their knack for picking up
                            new information quickly, they do learn other languages as necessary.
