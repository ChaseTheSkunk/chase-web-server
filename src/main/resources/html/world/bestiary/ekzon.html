                        <p>
                            <strong>Name:</strong> Ekzon<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> ek-ZAWN<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Drazomagnus caballinus</em><br>
                            <strong>Classification:</strong> Feral<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 2-4' (0.6-1.2 m)<br>
                            <strong>Threat Level:</strong> Low<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> None<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From <em>equine</em>, horse-like, and the Common ending <em>-zon</em> meaning from the
                            drazon family.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Ekzons vary in size, coloration, markings, build, and speed depending on the breed of the
                            individual creature. However, all breeds carry many similar characteristics. They are all
                            scaly creatures that stand on all fours. All four feet have four digits, each with long,
                            sharp claws. The undersides of their feet have thick, black, rubbery pads that protect them
                            from rough terrain. All ekzons also have long, whip-like tails. Horns or spines grow from
                            the backs of their heads based on the breed of ekzon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Wild ekzons live in the plains regions all over Casarok. Domesticated ekzons are common in
                            all parts of the world.

                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Ekzons are often ill-tempered creatures. The level of the temper they exhibit is based on
                            the breed though. Some breeds are extremely temperamental while others can be more
                            mild-mannered. These are usually split into "hot blooded" and "cold blooded" categories by
                            breeders and tamers. Ekzons are known for their running capabilities. Wild ekzons, in fact,
                            are known to challenge each other in feats of speed, either as a show of superiority or as
                            a way of attracting a potential mate. Although they have large bulk and ample defense with
                            their claws, they will rarely fight and instead prefer to run from danger. Ekzons are
                            omnivorous. In the wild, they eat a wide variety of plants. They also chase down and trample
                            small game when it comes to eating meat. In captivity they are fed specialized diets that
                            are mostly made up of fruits and vegetables.

                            <strong>Interactions:</strong>
                            Domesticated ekzons are used for a wide variety of tasks. Throughout history they have been
                            used for agricultural means. In earlier times before the invention of locomotives and
                            automobiles, they were the primary means of ground transportation due to their speed and
                            stamina. In modern times, they are used for sport. Equestrian is a popular pastime among
                            the wealthy, who have the money capable of housing and feeding these large creatures. Ekzon
                            racing is another common recreational activity. Some Anthros partake in gambling on races.
                            Regardless of the activity they are involved in, it is common practice to cut away or file
                            down the spines or horns that grow on their heads to avoid risk of injury to the rider.
                            Some ekzon owners also fashion special shoes or magic shells for their feet to help protect
                            them from wear.
