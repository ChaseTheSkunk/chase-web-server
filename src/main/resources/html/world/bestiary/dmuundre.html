                        <p>
                            <strong>Name:</strong> Dmuun'dre<br>
                            <strong>Other Names:</strong> Spirit Dragon<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> de-mun-DRAY<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Draco spiritus</em><br>
                            <strong>Race:</strong> Draconic<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> ~4' (~1.22 m)<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/spirit.png" title="Spirit" alt="Spirit"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the dmuun'dre language, <em>dmu un</em> meaning "sky-soaring dragon" and <em>dre</em>
                            meaning "spirit".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Dmuun'dre have thin, fine scales across the majority of their bodies. They generally range
                            in color from purple to pink, though there have been anomalies in hue all of which are light
                            in color. Thicker white or pink scales line their fronts which, as with other Draconic
                            species, protect many of their vital organs. Their heads bear thin, long horns and finned
                            ears underneath. Hair starts from the tops of their heads and goes down the length of their
                            backs and tails in the form of a mane. A large fluffy plume of hair sits at the end of the
                            manes on their tails. Dmuun'dre bodies are long and slim, much unlike the other Draconic
                            species. Their digits all end in short claws. While they have no wings, another aspect of
                            their bodies that differentiates them from other Draconic species, they are able to fly
                            through the use of magic. Dmuun'dre lifespan tends to be around 350 years.

                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            The signature ability of the dmuun'dre is their soulfire breath. Rather than doing physical
                            damage to an opponent, their soulfire breath hurts the recipient's soul. They are also
                            known for their strong spirit magics, having some of the strongest magical abilities out of
                            all the Draconic species. Their innate magic grants them flight capabilities as well as
                            underwater breath. They are extremely versatile on any terrain, almost as much as the
                            <a href="draicinne.html">draicinni</a>. Dmuun'dre can also innately traverse the astral
                            plane and use astral projection. Through meditation they are capable of separating their
                            spirits from their bodies in order to accomplish either of these tasks.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Dmuun'dre live in a variety of areas from forest to mountains to the oceanside. They are most
                            commonly found in eastern Casarok, however.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Dmuun'dre build towns and cities in a variety of different habitats. They are very religious
                            creatures, and as such they center their town and cities around temples to the different
                            gods and goddesses who have granted them their magical powers. The largest and most prolific
                            temples are built to honor Shen Ling, the kirin goddess of spirit magic. Dmuun'dre
                            architecture is the envy of builders all across the world and many seek to copy their
                            techniques. Dmuun'dre government is mostly democratic; however, they take a relatively lax
                            approach to ruling. Their leader tends to be the religious leader of the village, and they
                            act more as an arbitrator than an enforcer of law. The dmuun'dre are fairly welcoming of
                            outsiders compared to other Draconic species. Those that tend to separate themselves from
                            the rest of society still rather welcoming to those who stumble upon their cities, but they
                            aren't so keen on letting them leave and divulge their location to the rest of the world.
                            One such village is the mythical Shangri'la: A place where it is said the most devout of
                            dmuun'dre live and a place of great spiritual power, but it is so shrouded in mystery that
                            none know whether or not it truly exists.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Dmuun'dre are omnivorous. Nevertheless, many spirit dragons have a tendency to prefer
                            plant-based foods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            The preferred language of the dmuun'dre in the past has been Zhang-Zhung. From there the
                            language evolved into a variety of other languages with dialects differing between various
                            regions. In general, most dmuun'dre who have not remained separated from the world at large
                            have picked up the Common language after its spread.
