                            <strong>Name:</strong> Dašungallu<br>
                            <strong>Other Names:</strong> Storm Dragon<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> DAH-shoon-gah-loo<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Draco nimbosus</em><br>
                            <strong>Race:</strong> Draconic<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3.5-4.5' (1-1.3 m)<br>

                                                                  <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/wind.png" title="Wind" alt="Wind"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From dašungallish, the language of the dašungallu, <em>adad</em> meaning "thunder" and
                            <em>šungallu</em> meaning "dragon".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Dašungallï have primarily yellow scales with slightly thicker blue scales across their
                            front and undersides. Their head is marked by spikes growing out the sides of their faces
                            and bright blue, serrated horns that look like lightning bolts when viewed at certain
                            angles. On top of their heads are brightly colored hair ranging from yellow to green to
                            blue, which is traditionally kept in a wild style. Dašungallï have no visible ears, making
                            them look particularly reptilian like their primordial ancestors. The tail is long and
                            flexible with a barbed, sharp point at the end. Rather than having wings on their backs,
                            their wings are attached to their arms. Additionally, dašungallï have the longest wingspan
                            of any Draconic species. Both their arms and feet have opposable digits, allowing them to
                            grip objects with any of their limbs. The average lifespan of a dašungallu is around 300
                            years.

                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            Dašungallï wield wind as their breath attack. They are capable of exhaling a large gust of
                            wind to push back foes or disorient and knock down airborne opponents. This wind breath can
                            also be used to create a bubble of air around them. Coupled with their natural gift for
                            flight, dašungallï can use this air pocket to fly nimbly and at very high speeds. Magically,
                            they are able to use both lightning and wind magics. With these powers combined they can
                            summon storms to aid them in battle. Their spiked tail tips can be used not only as a focal
                            point for these magics but also as a competent spear weapon to impale foes. In combat, they
                            have a tendency to use deceptive tactics through their combined abilities to disorient,
                            paralyze, and strike their opponents.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Dašungallï are generally more spread out in the world than their other Draconic
                            counterparts. Their most common homes are at high altitudes like mountains and cloudlands.
                            Some dašungallï prefer the prairies though where storms and lightning are prevalent.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            It is customary for a dašungallu to cross their arms over their chest when not in flight,
                            wrapping their wings over the fronts of their bodies. This gesture is particularly used when
                            meeting those of high respect or regard. They gather in tribes and have a tribal-like
                            structure to their government. Tribes of dašungallï often work together and align with one
                            another. Most other races and species are treated with disdain. If they are approached by
                            someone who is not seen as much of a threat, the dašungallï will tolerate, tease, or
                            outright trick them in a jostling manner. If they are approached by a threat or a hated
                            enemy like the <a href="dracamma.html">dracammas</a>, then they will react brutally and with
                            much violence.

                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Dašungallï are omnivorous, although they have a heavy preference toward meat. Hunting and
                            farming are both popular methods of gathering food; however, hunting is more favorable for
                            those that live in high altitudes. Their speedy fliying ability allows them to go great
                            distances to hunt for their food.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            Early in their history, dašungallï used Akkadian as their language of choice. The language
                            eventually evolved into Dašungallish. Some of them adopted the Common language upon its
                            inception. In modern times, they speak either Common or Dašungallish based on the tribe
                            they come from.
