                            <strong>Name:</strong> Dracamma<br>
                            <strong>Other Names:</strong> Fire Dragon<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> drah-CAHM-muh<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Draco ignis</em><br>
                            <strong>Race:</strong> Draconic<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3.5-4.5' (1-1.3 m)<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/fire.png" title="Fire" alt="Fire"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From Dracammarum, <em>draco</em> meaning "dragon" and <em>flamma</em> meaning "flame".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Dracammas have fiery red scales across their body. Along their front they have large, thick
                            orange scales that act like plated armor, protecting their necks and vital organs. Two horns
                            sprout outward from the back of their heads and a third smaller horn sits in the middle of
                            their rounded snouts. All dracammas have hair but only on their heads and always of a dark
                            color. Their tails are long with rough spikes lining the tops of them. On their backs are
                            a pair of thin dragon wings, capable of flight (though only through magic as they are too
                            heavy to fly alone.) Their wingspans can reach nearly the height of their bodies. The
                            average lifespan of a dracamma is over 300 years.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            All dracammas are capable of breathing fire and using various fire magics. The most talented
                            dracammas are capable of producing magma either magically or within their bodies and firing
                            them like cannonballs. They also have a tolerance for extreme temperatures. On one end of
                            the spectrum, they can ignite themselves without being damaged. On the other end, their
                            internal fire magic can keep their bodies warm in frigid conditions. Outside of their fiery
                            abilities, dracammas are strong and make exceptional warriors and hunters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Dracammas tend to live in hot areas. Volcanic regions are a common home for dracammas as
                            well as arid regions like deserts or low in the mountains where it does not get too cold.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Dracammas are proud warriors, and they have built their society around this strength for
                            thousands of years. They are very warlike, almost Spartan in nature. Even in modern times,
                            young dracammas are at least taught how to wield a weapon. Those who do not accept their
                            warrior ways are banished from their villages and cities. Villages are run by a Warchief
                            with laws and judicial decisions made by a Council of Elders. Individually, dracammas tend
                            to be reactionary and emotional. They are also trained in ways to keep their feelings under
                            control as they grow up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Dracammas are omnivorous with a preference for meat. However, they also farm milk and cheese
                            from captured ferals and eat vegetables imported from other nations as well. Dracammas are
                            also petravores, capable of eating and absorbing minerals from rocks. This characteristic
                            is particularly useful for some dracammas who do not live in areas where food is readily
                            available.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            Early in their history, dracammas spoke Latin. This eventually changed into the modern day
                            language known as Dracammarum. As with most races in Casarok, they also speak Common.
