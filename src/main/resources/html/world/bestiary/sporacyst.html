                            <strong>Name:</strong> Sporacyst<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> SPORE-uh-sist<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Floradon sporacystis</em><br>
                            <strong>Classification:</strong> Floradon<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3-4' (0.8-1.2 m)<br>
                            <strong>Threat Level:</strong> High<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/nature.png" title="Nature" alt="Nature"><br>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the Common language words <em>spore</em> and <em>cyst</em>. The root word <em>cyst</em>
                            refers to how it encapsulates the organism affected by its spores. The word has its roots
                            in Dracammarum.

                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Sporacysts are large green creatures in the general shape of an anthro. The shape of the
                            head, ears, and snout differ heavily between different individuals; however, they all have
                            vine-like tendrils spreading outward from the tops of their muzzles that drape over their
                            mouths like curtains. They have a hulking appearance to them with the top of the back
                            protruding out over top the head. This hump on their backs is always covered in moss. Often,
                            various types of fungi will sprout from this mossy covering. Vines or leaf fronds are also
                            attached to their bodies in a multitude of places. The arms and legs are thick and
                            muscular. The digits on the hands end in sharp claw-like protrusions while the feet take on
                            the general shape of roots.

                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Sporacysts live primarily in jungles and swamps. They have been known to live in forests,
                            however. Villages in the past have been overrun with these creatures as well.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Sporacysts are slow, lumbering creatures. They are almost entirely mindless with their only
                            will being to spread their spores to other creatures. These spores are their method of
                            reproduction. When inhaled or absorbed through an open wound, they infect the host. The
                            host then develops cold-like symptoms within a day or two. After another few days, they
                            can develop green splotches on their scales or fur. This discoloration can be difficult to
                            detect for some anthros who already have green skin or fur like certain dragons or
                            <a href="cu_sith.html">cu siths</a>. If the spores are not detected and treated before this
                            time, they will attack the brain of the host and start taking over the central nervous
                            system of the host. Twitching, convulsions, and brain damage are common at this stage of the
                            disease. Finally, the spores kill and take over the host as they become in a sort of
                            zombified state. The body changes rapidly after this stage, becoming stronger and growing
                            plant-based appendages, until they turn into the known image of a sporacyst like the one
                            pictured above.

                            <strong>Interactions:</strong>
                            Sporacysts are considered highly threatening and are often avoided when possible. They are
                            hunted out of necessity most often. Nonetheless, the mushrooms that grow on their backs are
                            usually those with medicinal or alchemical properties. The fungi are often harvested when a
                            sporacyst is hunted down. Because of the disease they cause with their spores, special
                            facial masks have been developed to prevent their inhalation. Healers and doctors in areas
                            where the threat of sporacyst contact is high are required to know magic or medicine that
                            can counteract the disease brought on by the spores.
