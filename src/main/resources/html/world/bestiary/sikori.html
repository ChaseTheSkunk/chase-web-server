                            <strong>Name:</strong> Sikori<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> SI-ko-ree<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Vulpes felinea</em><br>
                            <strong>Race:</strong> Anthro<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3-4' (0.8-1.2 m)<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> None<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            Unknown
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            The sikori are vulpine in appearance save for some distinctive features that make them
                            similar to cats. The most distinctive of these features being their long, sharp, retractable
                            claws. The other feline aspect being their shortened muzzles. All in all, they are more akin
                            to fennec foxes than cats. Their large, triangular ears; lean, athletic builds; and fluffy,
                            brush-like tails make them distinctly vulpine. Another distinct feature is their headfur,
                            which is often lond and stylized.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            Sikori are known for their sharp, retractable claws. They are devastating weapons in and of
                            themselves, potentially being some of the deadliest claws among all species in Casarok. They
                            are also very athletic and accustomed to warm weather climates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Sikori have a tendency to live in the southeastern desert region of Casarok. Population
                            distribution has widened over time to the point in which they can also be found in eastern
                            and central Casarok.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Sikori put survival first and foremost as they usually come from harsh environments. They
                            learn to hunt and fight at a young age. Even in more modern times, sikori are known to pass
                            down their techniques to their offspring. Magic is also an important part of sikori life.
                            <a href="../magic.html">Water elementalists</a> are highly regarded as they are necessary
                            to find water in the regions from which they originate. Because of their survivalist
                            attitude and fighting prowess, they tend to be aggressive in nature. In the past they were
                            known for conquering other villages, including those with other sikori. In modern times
                            this behavior  is much more toned down, but some sikori still have the tendency to get riled
                            up on occasion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Sikori thrive on low amounts of food and water, being mostly desert dwellers. They are
                            usually not picky when it comes to choice of food, but they do have a slight preference for
                            dishes prepared from smaller creatures and plants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            Sikori always spoke regional languages prior to the inception of the Common language,
                            depending on which kingdom they inhabited.
