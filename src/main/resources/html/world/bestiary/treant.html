                            <strong>Name:</strong> Treant<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> TREE-ent<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Floradon treantus</em><br>
                            <strong>Classification:</strong> Floradon<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 3-4' (0.8-1.2 m)<br>
                            <strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/nature.png" title="Nature" alt="Nature"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the Dracammarum word <em>treantus</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Treants are hyperevolved deciduous trees, given mobility and a mind. Their bodies are that
                            of tree trunks, their legs are made up of two thick roots, and their arms are two thick
                            branches. While the feet do not end in any foot-like protrusions, the arms have large hands
                            that end in sharpened digits. Other plant-like appendages such as vines and thorns can be
                            found on the arms, depending on the subspecies of treant. The eyes and mouth of a treant are
                            generally hollowed out portions toward the upper portions of their trunks. Their tops are
                            covered in a network of branches and leaves. The bark covering their entire bodies acts
                            similar to a coat of light armor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Treants generally live deep in deciduous forests and jungles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Treants are very protective of their lands, even against other treants. They become
                            particularly aggressive when the trees in their territory are cut down or burned. In such
                            cases treants are known to leave their lands and attack Anthros and other creatures in a fit
                            of rage. Attacks are usually done by clawing, punching, or kicking enemies. Some treants
                            have the capability to attack using their vine or thorn appendages. Others still can use
                            razor-sharp leaves to cut into their foes. Some treants have access to nature magic and can
                            use it to harm or heal. Despite their perceived lack of intelligence, they are known to come
                            together and fight in groups. They even have a psuedo-hierarchy among their own kind: Those
                            that wield magic have a greater tendency to be leader than more physically based warriors.
                            As far as food goes, treants mostly photosynthesize their own food. When they do eat, they
                            tend to eat fruits and small insects. This consumption helps fuel their sap production.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Interactions:</strong>
                            Treants are often not interacted with by Anthros in the world as these creatures are rarely
                            considered worth the effort for the items they produce. However, some do harvest the sap
                            they produce to make into syrups and sugary treats. More often than not, they are fought to
                            protect their own territory from invasion. The arms and bark do act as makeshift weapons
                            and armor, usable by travellers in the forest.
