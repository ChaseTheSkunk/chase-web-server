                            <strong>Name:</strong> Taerundrin<br>
                            <strong>Other Names:</strong> Lost Children of the Forest<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> tie-RUN-drin<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Spiritus juvenis</em><br>
                            <strong>Classification:</strong> Monster<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 2-3' (0.6-0.9 m)<br>
                            <strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderately Low<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/spirit.png" title="Spirit" alt="Spirit"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the Darcanissi language meaning "forest gloom".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Taerundrin come in varying shapes and sizes, each one taking the appearance of the species
                            they once were before becoming a Lost Soul. Regardless of the species they appear as, their
                            coloration is always a deep gray or black. Their eyes, nose, and mouth glow a soft yellow
                            color; however, these features can change color depending on their mood. They all wear
                            makeshift clothing made from sticks, straw, leaves, and other material easily accessible in
                            the forest. Most of their bodies remain shrouded by their clothes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Taerundrin tend to stay in the forests. They are rarely, if ever, seen outside of a wooded
                            area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Taerundrin act mostly bestially but still have remnants of childlike behaviors. Nevertheless
                            Anthros do not maintain their humanity once becoming a taerundrin. If they are part of a
                            pack, taerundrin seem very happy and are obsessed with playing all day and night. If they
                            are alone, they appear gloomy or sad and are fixed on finding their lost parents despite
                            having become monsters. Their parents are the only things they remember of their old lives.
                            When coming across an outsider, they will react with innocent kindness and flock to them at
                            first. If angered they fight back with minor spirit magic. If such an outsider were
                            hopelessly lost or near death in their travels through the forest, the taerundrin may
                            instead turn them into a Lost Soul only to suffer the same fate as the monsters themselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Interactions:</strong>
                            Stories are told of children who got lost in the woods and become spirits as precautionary
                            tales to protect them. Few who tell these tales are actually sure taerundrin exist, but
                            these stories are passed down from generation to generation. Groups of taerundrin will turn
                            people into Lost Souls if an Anthro allows them to, so general warnings are given to
                            travelers in the forest. They are not hunted for food, but their ribbons are sometimes
                            kept as mementos or trophies for those who encounter taerundrin and return to tell of them.
