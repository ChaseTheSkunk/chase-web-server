                            <strong>Name:</strong> Terraboldt<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> tear-uh-BOLD<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Aldabrachelys forctis</em><br>
                            <strong>Classification:</strong> Monster<br>
                            <strong>Height:</strong> 4-6' (1.2-1.8 m)<br>
                            <strong>Threat Level:</strong> Moderate<br>
                            <strong>Associated Elements:</strong> <img class="element-image" src="../../../img/elements/earth.png" title="Earth" alt="Earth"><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the Common words <em>terrapin</em> and <em>boulder</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Terraboldts are similar to giant tortoises in appearance. They have green or brown scaly
                            skin on their heads, limbs, and tail. A large shell covers the torsos of these monsters.
                            They are set apart from tortoises, however, by the composition of their shells. While the
                            base composition of the shell is bone, the outer covering is fused with rock plating and
                            shards. This attribute tends to make the shell jagged and bumpy rather than smooth. It also
                            makes the shell extremely resistant to damage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Terraboldts live in mountains and caverns. Due to their often slow nature, a terraboldt is
                            never seen outside of these regions unless captured and brought somewhere by an anthro.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Terraboldts have a tendency to be calm and sluggish. They are strictly petravorous, meaning
                            they only eat rocks to obtain the essential minerals they need to live. Thus, they do not
                            hunt. They are often not alarmed by others coming by and will not fight unless they feel '
                            truly threatened. When becoming aggressive, terraboldts have the ability to call upon
                            powerful earth magics. They can charge at enemies at surprisingly high speeds by moving the
                            very ground beneath them. It is a common approach for these monsters to retreat into their
                            shells and roll at an attacker like a boulder. They can also fire off shards of rocks from
                            their shells like large bullets. These abilities are only available to terraboldts once they
                            are of age. Early in the life of a terraboldt, they have softer, bony shells. By rolling on
                            the ground and consuming rocks, they build up the toughness of their shells and their earth
                            magic abilities over time. Until they are ready to defend themselves, they are under the
                            close protection of their parents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Interactions:</strong>
                            Terraboldts are often left alone by travellers and adventurers. They aren't particularly
                            dangerous unless threatened, and they typically don't provide any renown for killing them.
                            The shells can be useful as a makeshift basin or cauldron and have been used as such
                            throughout the early ears of Casarokan history.
