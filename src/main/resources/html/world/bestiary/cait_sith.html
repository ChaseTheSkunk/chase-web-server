                            <strong>Name:</strong> Cait Sith<br>

                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Felis caitsidha</em><br>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the <a href="draicinne.html">draicinni</a> language <em>cait sidhe</em> meaning "cat
                            faerie".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Cait Siths are nearly indistinguishable from black cat Anthros. The main difference,
                            however, is the prominent patch of white fur on their chest. Aside from that, they also
                            bear light colored noses and ears.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            Prior to the <a href="../history.html#cataclysmic-age">Great Cataclysm</a>, all cait siths
                            drew their power from their matron deity, <a href="../pantheon.html">Maita</a>. Generally,
                            this gave them shapeshifting capabilities. The most known of these abilities was the power
                            to turn into a feral-like cat. Outside of their shapeshifting magic, they were natural
                            wizards in either the dark or light arts. Those who studied dark magic were known as
                            <a href="../classes/witches.html">witches</a> and those who studied light magic were
                            <a href="../classes/wiccans.html">wiccans</a>. In the Post-Cataclysmic Era, they
                            maintained their witch and wiccan traditions, including learning the magics of their
                            ancestors. Those talented enough could still be taught to transform into feral-like cats.

                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Most cat siths prefer living in the countryside in small villages. Others kept deep in the
                            forests to practice their rituals.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Cait siths primarily stick together. They often form covens together in small villages and
                            practice their magic. Wiccans and witches do not intermingle with each other, and it is
                            often frowned upon even to learn the magics of the other group. Since they all worship the
                            same goddess, they do not aggressively attack each other nevertheless. At best wiccan and
                            witch covens become tenuous allies. Wiccan covens are led by a High Priest and Priestess
                            while witch covens are led by the Great Brother and Sister. Most covens are run
                            democratically, nevertheless, with the respective leaders acting as arbitrators and ritual
                            coordinators. Modern day cait siths don't all stay in covens; they are more commonly
                            integrated with the rest of society. Regardless of their status, most of them dabble in
                            wiccan rituals or witchcraft on the side as a hobby.

                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Cait siths do not have a diet different from any other Anthro. Nevertheless, their heritage
                            usually drives them to eat more natural or organic foods.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            Before the creation of the Common language, most cait siths spoke a variety of languages.
                            The most used language was that of the draicinni, similar to the Earth language of Old
                            Irish.
