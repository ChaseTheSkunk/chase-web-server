                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From a southern Casarokan language, <em>garuda</em> meaning "devourer".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Garudas are typically similar in color and appearance to an eagle or kite Anthro. Their
                            feathers range from white to red to brown in color. Like most winged Aspects, their wings
                            are on their backs. Their forearms and hands are similar to their shins and feet, scaly with
                            talons, as opposed to avian Anthros who have wing-like arms.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            Before the <a href="../history.html#cataclysmic-age">Cactaclysmic Age</a>, all garudas
                            gained their powers from the deity <a href="../pantheon.html">Stratos</a>. This power
                            granted them access to various air and cloud magics. They could even create clouds that one
                            could stand upon. Aside from their main focus, they could learn various wind, light, and
                            frost spells.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Garudas live all over Casarok. Their population is very spread out from as far west as the
                            <a href="../geography.html">Acaraho Mountains</a> to the farthest eastern reaches of the
                            world. They also inhabit the northern and southern mountains as well. They have a preference
                            for higher elevations and tend to stick close to the mountain ranges in those regions.
                            Strangely enough, they are rare to find in central Casarok. Furthermore, they are known to
                            live in the cloudlands.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            Garudas have a natural love of the sky. It is not uncommon for places where garudas live to
                            have tall towers and structures. They can also be seen flying in the areas where they live.
                            In places where many garudas gather, they create cloudlands high in the sky. The practice of
                            creating cloudlands was frowned upon more and more as time went on, however, due to the
                            perpetual shadows they cast upon the ground. In modern times, creating new cloudlands is
                            nearly forbidden unless special permission is granted from the local government. Regardless,
                            many garudas have a preference for living in these cloudlands. Aside from their choice of
                            living establishment, garudas are fairly friendly with other anthros in Casarok. They tend
                            to be quite inviting and will even offer a lift on their backs should the need arise for a
                            short flight. In times of war through history, garudas have a preference for lances and
                            bows. Garudas are known throughout Casarok to be some of the most skilled archers in the
                            world.

                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            The diet of a garuda depends on the region he or she is from. They enjoy various foods that
                            are grown only in the cloudlands. Those that live in the mountains or by the sea tend to
                            favor local fish.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            Garudas never spoke a single language in their history. They always spoke the languages
                            local to their population. Eventually, as with all of Casarok, they picked up the Common
                            language.
