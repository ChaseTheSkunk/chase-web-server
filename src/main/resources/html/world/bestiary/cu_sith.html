                            <strong>Name:</strong> Cu Sith<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> Coo Sith<br>
                            <strong>Scientific Name:</strong> <em>Canis cusidhus</em><br>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Etymology:</strong>
                            From the <a href="draicinne.html">draicinni</a> language <em>cu sidhe</em> meaning "dog
                            faerie".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
                            Cu Siths look much like dog Anthros aside from their green fur. They also have long pointed
                            ears on their heads and long tails. Their eyes are generally a fiery red or orange color.
                            Their hair is usually dark in color, most of the time black.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Abilities:</strong>
                            Before the <a href="../history.html#cataclysmic-age">Cactaclysmic Age</a>, all cu siths
                            drew their power from their patron deity, <a href="../pantheon.html">Ferni</a>. This granted
                            them access to two classes of spells.
                            <a href="../classes/osteomancer.html">Osteomancers</a> could call upon spirit magic by
                            utilizing bones as a channeling mechanism. Through osteomancy a cu sith could control
                            skeletons among other things. Hellcallers, on the other hand, used fire and darkness magic
                            to call upon the forces of the underworld. In the Post-Cataclysmic Era, most cu siths
                            practice a wider variety of magics. Some still hold on to their osteomancing or hellcalling
                            roots, but those are practiced less often due to being borderline forbidden arts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Habitat:</strong>
                            Most cu siths have come to prefer larger villages, towns, or cities as their home. Some of
                            them have a preference for regions of volcanic activity. Others live in seclusion to
                            practice more dubious magical arts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Behavior:</strong>
                            The living arrangements for cu siths are dependent on the type of magic they practice. Those
                            who do not use magic or use approved forms of magic tend to be more integrated into society.
                            Those who practice the magic of their patron deity tend to be more reclusive. Entire
                            villages of cu sith were not uncommon. They were mostly avoided, however, due to their
                            dire reputation. In general, cu siths tend to be physically strong. In the past they were
                            very rough and tumble and would flaunt their strengths in battle. A cu sith would not be
                            remiss to save the bones from the slain or hunted. They would keep piles of these bones in
                            their homes; although, in more modern times hunters would usually showcase bones from their
                            particularly tough kills in a neater fashion. On a side note, some cu siths will
                            traditionally braid their long and furry tails. The tradition usually depends on family
                            history.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Diet:</strong>
                            Cu sith diets are fairly similar to those of other Anthros and Aspects. They do have a
                            tendency to prefer red meat though.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Language:</strong>
                            Before the creation of the Common language, most cau siths spoke a variety of languages.
                            The most common of these was the language of the draicinni, similar to the Earth
                            language of Old Irish.
