                    <p>
                        Magic has been a driving force in Casarok throughout its long history. Since the first days of
                        the intelligent life, mortals have been able to wield magic either through inherently being born
                        with it or learning it through rigorous study.
                        <a href="pantheon.html">The gods and goddesses</a> of Casarok, on the other hand, have always
                        been able to use magic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Magic is used by drawing from one's own mana, the life force that exists within all creatures
                        and the very planet itself. By manipulating one's mana in various methods and quantities, a
                        person can cast a plethora of spells. Mana is a limited resource, however, due to the fact that
                        it draws from the very power that sustains life. One's mana is depleted when their life force is
                        weakened to the point that drawing from it further would do damage to the user. Mana can be
                        restored by resting, eating, drinking, or consuming special products like mana potions that
                        boost one's life force.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wielding magic can be dangerous to the user under certain circumstances. The most common magical
                        affliction is known as mana sickness. If one continues to use magic beyond the zero-mana
                        threshold previously stated, then they become susceptible to this disease the more they continue
                        to cast spells. Symptoms include coughing, paleness of the skin or fur, and chills. Extreme
                        cases can lead to permanent maximum mana reduction, muscular atrophy, coma, or even death. On
                        the opposite end of the spectrum, one can have mana addiction. This affliction is noted by the
                        physiological need to imbibe mana potions constantly. Mana addiction can be developed by
                        fluctuations in life force such as consistently using and restoring mana. Symptoms are very
                        similar to that of an alcohol or drug addiction. Despite the possible dangers, most magic users
                        only experience slightly accelerated aging over their lifetime from tapping into their life
                        force.

                        Magic is divided into four schools (arcane, elemental, metaphysical, divine) and 12 elements
                        (fire, frost, lightning, earth, water, air, light, dark, nature, spirit, time, space). The
                        diagram below shows how they are divided:

                         alt="Arcane: Fire, Frost, Lightning, Space /
                                    Elemental: Earth, Water, Air, Time /
                                    Metaphysical: Light, Dark, Nature, Spirit /
                                    Divine: Light, Dark, Space, Time">

                    <p>
                        <strong>The School of the Arcane</strong> deals with the use of mana to manipulate various
                        energies surrounding the user. Some elements, such as Frost and Space can utilize physical
                        forces, but for the most part they are purely magical energies. Only those of great intellect
                        are capable of mastering arcane magic. Masters of the four arcane arts are known as
                        <em>mages</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The School of the Elements</strong> works with the forces of the very planet itself.
                        Most of its power is physical in nature, though some elements in this school draw from the
                        deep geological span of Casarok. Earth and Time in particular can utilize these geological
                        forces. It takes great force of will to control the powers of the elements. Masters of the four
                        elemental arts are known as <em>elementalists</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The School of the Metaphysical</strong> teaches the use of intangible forces. These
                        forces can be observed and studied, but they cannot be fully grasped except by those who
                        understand these particular elements. All these elements are capable of healing, each with
                        its own method of doing so. In order to become a strong magic user in the realm of the
                        metaphysical must be strong in spirit. Masters of the four elemental arts are known as
                        <em>wizards</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The School of the Divine</strong> encapsulates the strongest magic powers in the
                        universe. These are powers that can only be understood or granted by the gods and goddesses of
                        Casarok. As such, the only mortal that can use divine magic powers are their direct emissaries.
                        These include <em>champions</em> and <em>oracles</em> though rarely they are wielded by their
                        lesser counterparts, <em>agents</em> and <em>priests or priestesses</em>.
