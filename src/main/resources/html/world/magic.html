                    <p>
                        Magic has been a driving force in Casarok throughout its long history. Since the first days of
                        the intelligent life, mortals have been able to wield magic either through inherently being born
                        with it or learning it through rigorous study.
                        <a href="pantheon.html">The gods and goddesses</a> of Casarok, on the other hand, have always
                        been able to use magic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Magic is used by drawing from one's own mana, the life force that exists within all creatures
                        and the very planet itself. By manipulating one's mana in various methods and quantities, a
                        person can cast a plethora of spells. Mana is a limited resource, however, due to the fact that
                        it draws from the very power that sustains life. One's mana is depleted when their life force is
                        weakened to the point that drawing from it further would do damage to the user. Mana can be
                        restored by resting, eating, drinking, or consuming special products like mana potions that
                        boost one's life force.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wielding magic can be dangerous to the user under certain circumstances. The most common magical
                        affliction is known as mana sickness. If one continues to use magic beyond the zero-mana
                        threshold previously stated, then they become susceptible to this disease the more they continue
                        to cast spells. Symptoms include coughing, paleness of the skin or fur, and chills. Extreme
                        cases can lead to permanent maximum mana reduction, muscular atrophy, coma, or even death. On
                        the opposite end of the spectrum, one can have mana addiction. This affliction is noted by the
                        physiological need to imbibe mana potions constantly. Mana addiction can be developed by
                        fluctuations in life force such as consistently using and restoring mana. Symptoms are very
                        similar to that of an alcohol or drug addiction. Despite the possible dangers, most magic users
                        only experience slightly accelerated aging over their lifetime from tapping into their life
                        force.

                        Magic is divided into four schools (arcane, elemental, metaphysical, divine) and 12 elements
                        (fire, frost, lightning, earth, water, air, light, dark, nature, spirit, time, space). The
                        diagram below shows how they are divided:

                    <p>
                        Masters of the four arcane arts are known as mages, the elemental arts are elementalists, and
                        the metaphysical arts are wizards. Divine spells are reserved only for gods, goddesses, and
                        their direct emissaries.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Fire</strong><br>
                            Fire magic generally utilizes flames and heat to deal damage to enemies. Spells like
                            Fireball and Heat Wave are common for this task. Some spells are capable of inflicting burns
                            as well. Other spells, like Flamebrand, are capable of imbuing weapons with fire magic,
                            adding previously mentioned spell effects or damage to it. Rarely, fire spells will grant
                            some form of assistance. For example, Cauterize closes wounds to prevent someone from
                            bleeding out. Masters of the fire element are known as <em>pyromancers</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Frost</strong><br>
                            Frost magic calls upon ice, snow, and cold for its spells. Common damage-inducing spells
                            include Frostbolt and Cold Snap. Some spells like Freeze will instead encase someone in ice,
                            immobilizing them or preserving them from damage. Frost magic is also capable of slowing
                            movement, shrouding someone in a fog, or summon a blizzard to reduce enemy visibility. As
                            for weapon-based magic, weapons like spears and maces can be created from ice. Users of the
                            frost element are known as <em>cryomancers</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Lightning</strong><br>
                            Lightning magic is denoted by the use of sparks, lightning, and storms. Damage dealing
                            spells like Lightning Bolt and Storm Surge are a key part of a thunder mage's repertoire.
                            Some lightning spells are capable of inflicting paralyzing or stunning effects on a target
                            like Shock. Area of effect spells are also a staple of lightning magic. Thunderstorm and
                            Spark Shower are capable of spreading electricity throughout an area. Weapon-based spells
                            tend to make the weapon lighter through magnetic force or paralyze the foe upon strike.
                            Lightning magic users are known as <em>electromancers</em>.

                            <strong>Space (Arcane)</strong><br>
                            In the School of the Arcane, space magic is fairly limited. The most common spells in this
                            class are for creating portals, teleportation, far sight, spatial awareness, and summoning.
                            Objects can also be created from pure mana, but that mana becomes unusable until the
                            conjured object is dismissed. Some damage dealing attacks exist as well, usually through the
                            manipulation of gravity as in Gravity Bolt or the power of stars like Starfire. Arcane space
                            mages are known as <em>conjurers</em> and <em>summoners</em>.
