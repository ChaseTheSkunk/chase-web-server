                            <strong>Name:</strong> Injuja<br>
                            <strong>Pronunciation:</strong> in-joo-JUH<br>

                            Members of the injuja class are masters of the martial art known in as injujutsu, which
                            roughly translates as the art of the ribbon. It is a practice that combines ribbon dancing,
                            unarmed combat, and magic. Much of the history of this art is lost, but archaeologists have
                            determined that its origin dates as far back as the
                            <a href="../history.html">Empirical Age</a>. It is believed to have been developed by women
                            dancers in eastern Casarok seeking a way to defend themselves properly from would be
                            attackers, anthro or monster. It is taught primarily as a means of self-defense and to be
                            non-lethal, though injujas have joined the ranks of mages in times of war.

                            The use of magic in injujutsu relies on a runed ribbon as the focus for spells. There are
                            usually two runes on a ribbon, one on each end. The type of magic cast is dependent on the
                            <a href="../magic.html">element</a> of the rune inscribed on the end of the ribbon. When one
                            end of the ribbon is whipped the rune on that end fires off its spell, usually at higher
                            speeds than is capable without the use of the ribbon. It is possible to inscribe a third
                            rune in the center of a ribbon, although this is usually reserved for wind or lightning
                            magic. Wind runes are used to help strangle a victim with the ribbon and rob them of air
                            faster. Lightning runes are used to help incapacitate a victim by shocking them.

                            The unarmed combat side of injutsu is along the lines of dance fighting arts. It teaches
                            graceful movement in battle to dodge and weave around foes' attacks. Once the opponent is
                            left open, the injuja can retaliate with a variety of kicks and punches. If the attacker
                            utilizes a weapon or a magical focus of their own, the injuja can wrap their ribbon around
                            an arm or the object in question to disarm the foe or follow-up with an attack.

                            Injujutsu is a popular martial art among people in eastern Casarok. Its influence made its
                            way westward in the following ages, however. Although not quite as popular as other eastern
                            martial arts like jujutsu or karate, injujutsu still has its followers throughout the world,
                            even in modern times.
